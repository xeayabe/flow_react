## Authentication Flow

Flow uses a **fully passwordless** authentication system with optional biometric quick-login for enhanced security and convenience.

1. **Welcome Screen**:
   - Beautiful first impression with Flow branding
   - Animated water droplets forming currency symbols
   - Single "Get Started" button to begin signup flow
   - "Already have an account? Log in" link for returning users
   - Automatic redirect to dashboard if already logged in

2. **Signup** (Passwordless):
   - User fills signup form with:
     - Full name
     - Email address
     - **No password required!**
   - Validation rules enforced:
     - Email must be valid format
     - Email must not already be registered
     - Name minimum 2 characters
   - Info message explains: "No password needed! We'll send a secure verification code to your email."
   - Magic code sent to email via InstantDB
   - User enters 6-digit verification code
   - Upon verification:
     - User profile created in database
     - Default household created automatically
     - HouseholdMember record created linking user to household
     - User auto-logged in
     - Success modal with confetti animation
   - Redirect to dashboard

3. **Login** (Passwordless + Biometric):
   - **Biometric Quick-Login** (if enabled):
     - Button shown: "Log in with Face ID" or "Log in with Touch ID"
     - Tapping button triggers biometric authentication
     - Upon successful biometric auth: Email auto-filled and magic code sent
     - User still verifies with 6-digit code (hybrid security)
   - **Standard Email Login**:
     - User enters email only
     - System checks if user profile exists in database:
       - If no profile: Show error "No account found with this email. Please sign up first."
       - If profile exists AND not rate-limited: Send magic code to email via InstantDB
       - If rate-limited: Show error "Too many attempts. Please try again in X minutes"
     - User enters 6-digit verification code
     - Upon successful verification:
       - If biometric available and not enabled: Prompt to enable Face ID/Touch ID
       - User logged in → redirect to dashboard
   - **Important**: Users CANNOT receive a login code unless they have already signed up
   - **Security**: Passwordless authentication only - no passwords collected or validated

4. **Biometric Setup** (Optional Enhancement):
   - After first successful login on device with Face ID/Touch ID
   - App shows prompt: "Enable [Face ID/Touch ID]?"
   - User can enable for faster future logins or skip ("Maybe Later")
   - If enabled:
     - Email securely stored in Expo SecureStore
     - Only accessible after successful biometric authentication
     - Quick-login button appears on login screen
   - Can be disabled anytime from settings

5. **Auth Guards**:
   - Unauthenticated users redirected to signup
   - Authenticated users redirected to dashboard
   - Auth state managed by InstantDB SDK

## Key Security Features

- **Fully Passwordless Authentication**: Uses InstantDB Magic Codes - more secure than passwords
- **No Password Storage**: No passwords stored in database or transmitted anywhere
- **Email Verification Required**: Users must verify email with 6-digit code to authenticate
- **Profile Check on Login**: Ensures only registered users can receive login codes
- **Duplicate Email Prevention**: Checks for existing accounts during signup
- **Rate Limiting**: Maximum 5 failed attempts per minute per email
- **Automatic Lockout**: 15-minute lockout after exceeding rate limit
- **Biometric Security**:
  - Face ID/Touch ID optional for returning users
  - Email securely stored in Expo SecureStore
  - Only accessible after successful biometric authentication
  - Hybrid approach: Biometric auth + magic code verification
- **Session Management**: InstantDB handles secure session tokens
- **No Client-Side Secrets**: All sensitive operations server-side via InstantDB

## Design System

### Swiss Precision Aesthetic
Flow uses a distinctive **Swiss-inspired glassmorphism design system** that brings calm, mindful budgeting to life.

#### Core Design Tokens (`src/lib/design-tokens.ts`)

**Color Palette:**
- **Context Teal** (#2C5F5D) - Primary brand color, deep and sophisticated
- **Context Sage** (#A8B5A1) - Success states, on-track budgets
- **Context Lavender** (#B4A7D6) - Adjusted flow states (over budget)
- **Context Dark** (#1A1C1E) - Background base

**Budget Status Colors (4-tier system - NO RED!):**
- **0-70% spent**: Sage Green (#A8B5A1) - "On Track"
- **70-90% spent**: Soft Amber (#D4A574) - "Progressing"
- **90-100% spent**: Deep Teal (#2C5F5D) - "Nearly There"
- **100%+ spent**: Soft Lavender (#B4A7D6) - "Flow Adjusted"

**Philosophy**: No harsh red warnings. Budget overruns are reframed as "Flow Adjusted" to reduce financial anxiety.

**Glassmorphism:**
- Glass surfaces with subtle transparency (3-5% white opacity)
- Delicate borders with 5% white opacity
- Backdrop blur effects for depth
- Soft shadows for floating elements

**Currency Formatting:**
- Swiss CHF format: `CHF 1'234.50` (apostrophe as thousand separator)
- Always 2 decimal places
- Negative values: `-CHF 150.00`

**Typography Scale:**
- Hero: 48px / 700 weight (homepage headlines)
- H1: 32px / 600 weight (screen titles)
- H2: 24px / 600 weight (section headers)
- H3: 20px / 600 weight (card titles)
- Body: 16px / 400 weight (content)
- Caption: 14px / 400 weight (metadata)
- Label: 12px / 500 weight uppercase (field labels)

**Spacing Scale:** 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48 (multiples of 4)

**Border Radius:** 8, 12, 16, 24, full (9999)

#### Currency Formatting (`src/lib/formatCurrency.ts`)

The primary currency formatter with flexible options:

```typescript
import { formatCurrency } from '@/lib/formatCurrency';

// Standard format (default)
formatCurrency(13648.51) // "13'648.51 CHF"
formatCurrency(-150) // "-150.00 CHF"

// Without currency symbol
formatCurrency(1234.5, { showCurrency: false }) // "1'234.50"

// Show positive sign
formatCurrency(50, { showSign: true }) // "+50.00 CHF"
formatCurrency(-50, { showSign: true }) // "-50.00 CHF"
```

#### Budget Status Helpers (`src/lib/getBudgetColor.ts`)

Empathetic budget tracking with no harsh red warnings:

```typescript
import { getBudgetColor, getBudgetStatus } from '@/lib/getBudgetColor';

// Get color based on budget usage percentage
getBudgetColor(65)  // "#A8B5A1" (Sage Green)
getBudgetColor(85)  // "#D4A574" (Soft Amber)
getBudgetColor(95)  // "#2C5F5D" (Deep Teal)
getBudgetColor(105) // "#B4A7D6" (Soft Lavender)

// Get empathetic status text
getBudgetStatus(65)  // "ON TRACK"
getBudgetStatus(85)  // "PROGRESSING WELL"
getBudgetStatus(95)  // "NEARLY THERE"
getBudgetStatus(105) // "FLOW ADJUSTED" (not "Over Budget"!)
```

#### Emoji Extraction Helper (`src/lib/extractEmoji.ts`)

Extract emoji from category names that include emoji prefix:

```typescript
import { extractEmoji } from '@/lib/extractEmoji';

// Extract emoji from start of string
extractEmoji("🛒 Groceries")    // { emoji: "🛒", name: "Groceries" }
extractEmoji("🏠 Rent")         // { emoji: "🏠", name: "Rent" }
extractEmoji("No Emoji Here")   // { emoji: "📊", name: "No Emoji Here" }
```

Used by dashboard to properly display category emoji and name separately in BudgetItem and TransactionItem components.

#### Glassmorphism Components (`src/components/ui/Glass.tsx`)

Ready-to-use React Native components with Swiss glass aesthetics:

```typescript
import { GlassCard, GlassButton, GlassHeader, GlassInputContainer, GlassSection } from '@/components/ui/Glass';

// Card with glass effect
<GlassCard className="p-4">
  <Text>Content with subtle transparency</Text>
</GlassCard>

// Premium buttons
<GlassButton variant="primary" onPress={handleSubmit}>
  <Text className="text-white font-semibold">Save Budget</Text>
</GlassButton>

<GlassButton variant="secondary" onPress={handleCancel}>
  <Text className="text-white">Cancel</Text>
</GlassButton>

// Translucent header
<GlassHeader className="px-6 py-4">
  <Text className="text-white text-lg font-semibold">Settings</Text>
</GlassHeader>

// Input wrapper with focus state
<GlassInputContainer focused={isFocused}>
  <TextInput placeholder="Amount" />
</GlassInputContainer>

**Integration:**
The BudgetStatusCard is integrated into the main dashboard (`src/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`) and automatically fetches budget data from InstantDB. Budget details are enriched with category names, emojis, and groups before being passed to the component.

#### Household Balance Widget (`src/components/dashboard/HouseholdBalanceWidget.tsx`)

Prominent glass card that appears when there are unsettled shared expenses between household members:

```typescript
import { HouseholdBalanceWidget } from '@/components/dashboard/HouseholdBalanceWidget';
import { useHouseholdData } from '@/hooks/useHouseholdData';

const householdData = useHouseholdData();

<HouseholdBalanceWidget
  debtAmount={householdData.debtAmount}
  partnerName={householdData.partner?.name || 'Partner'}
  yourSplitRatio={householdData.yourSplitRatio}
  partnerSplitRatio={householdData.partnerSplitRatio}
  hasUnsettledExpenses={householdData.hasUnsettledExpenses}
/>
```

**useHouseholdData Hook** (`src/hooks/useHouseholdData.ts`):
Fetches and calculates household debt data:
- Finds partner in household
- Calculates net debt balance using `calculateDebtBalance`
- Retrieves split ratios using `calculateSplitRatio`
- Checks for unsettled expenses in `shared_expense_splits`
- Returns loading state for conditional rendering

**Features:**
- Pulsing glow animation for 10 seconds to draw attention
- Large debt amount display with Swiss formatting
- Clear debt direction: "You owe X" or "X owes you"
- Split ratio display (e.g., "59% / 41%")
- Primary teal button navigates to settlement flow
- Conditional rendering (auto-hides when debt is zero)

- Touch feedback stops animation

**Animation Details:**
- Pulse: Opacity 1 → 0.6 → 1 over 3 seconds
- Subtle scale variation (2%)
- Repeats 3 times (~9 seconds)
- Auto-stops after 10 seconds

#### Wallets Card (`src/components/wallets/WalletsCard.tsx`)

Collapsible glass card displaying all user wallets with totals and individual account details:

```typescript
import { WalletsCard } from '@/components/wallets';
import type { Account } from '@/lib/accounts-api';

const accounts: Account[] = [...]; // From getUserAccounts()

<WalletsCard
  accounts={accounts}
  onAccountPress={(account) => console.log('Tapped:', account.name)}
/>
```

**WalletItem Component** (`src/components/wallets/WalletItem.tsx`):
Individual wallet row component with icon, name, institution, and balance:

```typescript
import { WalletItem } from '@/components/wallets';

<WalletItem
  name="Main Checking"
  institution="UBS"
  type="Checking"
  balance={8547.32}
  isDefault={true}
  onPress={() => {}}
  animationDelay={0}
/>
```

**Features:**
- Collapsible with smooth Reanimated animations (300ms)
- ChevronDown icon rotates 180° when expanded
- Header shows total balance across all wallets
- Assets vs Liabilities summary row
- Sorted list: default account first, then by balance descending
- Type-specific icons (Wallet, CreditCard, PiggyBank, Banknote, TrendingUp)
- "Add Wallet" button at bottom
- Staggered FadeInDown animations for wallet items
- **CRITICAL: Uses neutral gray (#4B5563) for negative balances, NOT red!**
- "Amount Owed" label for credit cards and negative balances
- Default account badge with teal background

**Design Philosophy:**
Follows the Swiss precision aesthetic with empathetic design - negative balances (credit card debt) are shown in neutral gray rather than anxiety-inducing red. This aligns with Flow's calm financial control approach.
- Manual stop on button press

**Conditional Rendering:**
Widget only appears when:
1. `hasUnsettledExpenses = true`
2. `Math.abs(debtAmount) > 0.01 CHF`

**Test Page:** Navigate to `/test-household-balance` to see:
- Your actual household data (live)
- 6 mock scenarios with all debt directions
- Visual verification checklist
- Animation behavior
- Hook usage examples

**Dashboard Integration:**
The HouseholdBalanceWidget is integrated into the main dashboard (`src/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`) between the TrueBalanceWidget and BudgetStatusCard. It automatically:
- Fetches household data using `useHouseholdData` hook
- Only appears when partner exists and is not loading
- Conditionally renders based on `hasUnsettledExpenses` and debt amount
- Shows pulsing animation to draw attention to unsettled expenses
- Navigates to `/settle` when button is pressed

**Animation:**
- Slides in from 20px below
- Fades from opacity 0 to 1
- Ease-out timing
- Stagger by 100ms per card

#### Testing

**Visual Test Page:** `/design-test`
Navigate to this route in your app to see all design system components in action with automated acceptance criteria verification.

**Automated Tests:** Run `bun test-design-system.js` to verify:
- ✅ formatCurrency(13648.51) returns "13'648.51 CHF"
- ✅ formatCurrency(-4940.55) returns "-4'940.55 CHF"
- ✅ getBudgetColor(50) returns Sage Green #A8B5A1
- ✅ getBudgetColor(105) returns Soft Lavender #B4A7D6
- ✅ All components render without errors

#### Utilities

```typescript
import { formatCHF, getBudgetStatusColor, glassStyles, createGlassStyle } from '@/lib/design-tokens';

// Alternative currency formatter (prefix style)
formatCHF(1234.5) // "CHF 1'234.50"
formatCHF(-150) // "-CHF 150.00"

// Budget status colors (also available in design-tokens)
getBudgetStatusColor(65) // Sage Green (on track)
getBudgetStatusColor(85) // Soft Amber (progressing)
getBudgetStatusColor(105) // Soft Lavender (flow adjusted)

// Glassmorphism styles
<View style={glassStyles.card}>...</View>
<View style={createGlassStyle(0.05, 15)}>...</View>
```

### Custom Hooks (`src/hooks/useDashboardData.ts`)

Reusable hooks for fetching and aggregating dashboard data with React Query + InstantDB:

#### `useDashboardData()`

Complete dashboard data aggregation hook:

```typescript
import { useDashboardData } from '@/hooks/useDashboardData';

function Dashboard() {
  const {
    data,         // Aggregated data object
    loading,      // Combined loading state
    error,        // Combined error state
    refetch,      // Refetch all queries
    // Convenience accessors
    netWorth,     // number
    assets,       // number
    liabilities,  // number
    userId,       // string
    householdId,  // string
  } = useDashboardData();

  if (loading) return <LoadingSpinner />;

  return (
    <>
      <TruePositionHero
        netWorth={netWorth}
        assets={assets}
        liabilities={liabilities}
      />
      {/* Use data.accounts, data.transactions, etc. */}
    </>
  );
}
```

**Data Object Structure:**
```typescript
{
  user: UserRecord,
  member: HouseholdMember,
  budgetPeriod: { start, end, paydayDay, source, daysRemaining },
  balance: { netWorth, assets: { accounts, total }, liabilities: { accounts, total } },
  accounts: Account[],
  budgetSummary: { totalIncome, totalAllocated, totalSpent },
  transactions: Transaction[],
}
```

#### `useBalanceData()`

Simplified hook for just balance data (lighter weight):

```typescript
import { useBalanceData } from '@/hooks/useDashboardData';

function NetWorthCard() {
  const {
    balance,      // Full balance breakdown
    loading,      // Loading state
    error,        // Error state
    netWorth,     // number
    assets,       // number
    liabilities,  // number
  } = useBalanceData();

  return (
    <TruePositionHero
      netWorth={netWorth}
      assets={assets}
      liabilities={liabilities}
    />
  );
}
```

**Features:**
- Auto-refetches balance every 5 seconds
- Integrates with React Query caching
- Type-safe with TypeScript
- Handles loading and error states
- Automatically fetches budget period from member/household
- Combines multiple API calls into single hook

## Recent Updates

### Budget Tab - Edit Button Navigation Fixed (2026-01-24)
- Fixed issue where edit button was routing back to dashboard instead of opening edit screen
- Restructured Budget tab to support nested routes with Stack navigation
- Budget tab is now a folder with `index.tsx` (overview) and `setup.tsx` (edit)
- Edit button navigation updated to `/(tabs)/budget/setup` (was incorrectly pointing to `/budget/setup`)
- Users can now click the pencil icon on Budget tab to edit their budget allocation

### Analytics - Pie Chart Fixed (2026-01-24)
- Fixed pie chart segment click detection using angle-based geometry approach
- **Problem**: Previously stacked multiple Pressable components (each covering full chart), so only topmost received clicks
- **Solution**: Single Pressable wrapper with touch location → angle calculation to detect which segment was tapped
- Calculate angle from chart center to touch point using Math.atan2()
- Find which segment's angle range contains the calculated angle
- Clicking any pie segment correctly navigates to filtered transactions for that category
- Works reliably across all segments (Groceries, Entertainment, Snacks, etc.)

### Language & Date Format Fix (2026-01-24)
- Changed all date formatting to European format (DD/MM/YYYY)
- Locale changed to it-IT for all date/month formatting
- Affected areas: Trends page, Analytics, Transactions, Add/Edit screens, Calendar headers
- **Trends**: Month abbreviations now in English (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.) instead of Italian
- **Analytics**: Date range display now shows DD/MM/YYYY format (e.g., 24/01/2026 to 24/02/2026)
- **All dates**: Format DD/MM/YYYY with separator "/" (e.g., 24/01/2026)
- Currency formatting (CHF) still uses Swiss locale (de-CH) for proper number formatting

### Trends Monthly Breakdown - Clickable Rows (2026-01-24)
- Made monthly breakdown table rows clickable for easy transaction drill-down
- Click any month row to view transactions for that month
- Visual feedback: row highlights on hover with → arrow icon
- Automatically applies month date filter to transactions page
- Filter chip displays month/year with × to clear
- Enables investigating spending patterns by month
- **Example**: Click "January 2025" row → View all Jan 2025 transactions with month filter applied

### Analytics Period Fix (2026-01-24)
- Fixed analytics date range calculation for "This Period" when viewing before payday
- Now correctly shows period from last payday until today (not paydayDay - 1)
- Example: For payday on 25th, viewing on 24th now shows period ending on 24th (today) instead of 23rd

### Floating Action Button - Improved UX (2026-01-24)
- Enhanced FAB with better shadow styling for visual depth
- Added "Don't have an account? Add one" link in the Add Transaction modal

### Welcome Screen & Invite UX Fixes (2026-01-24)
- **Keyboard Avoidance**: Fixed welcome screen where keyboard was hiding invite code input
  - Wrapped bottom section in KeyboardAvoidingView with ScrollView
  - `keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled"` allows dismissing keyboard by tapping
  - Input field now remains visible when typing
- **Copy-on-Tap for Invite Codes**: Added clipboard integration in Invite Partner screen
  - Users can tap the large 6-digit code to copy it to clipboard
  - "Invite Code (tap to copy)" label provides clear affordance
  - Confirmation alert shows code was copied successfully
  - Uses expo-clipboard for cross-platform compatibility

### CRITICAL BUG FIX: Invite Role Assignment (2026-01-24)
- **Root Cause**: `createUserProfile` function was automatically creating a household and assigning admin role to ALL new users, even when they had an invite code
- **Result**: Invited users (like Cecilia) were getting their own household with admin role instead of joining the inviter's household as members
- **The Fix**:
  1. Split `createUserProfile` into two functions:
     - `createUserProfile`: Only creates user profile (no household)
     - `createDefaultHousehold`: Creates household and assigns admin role
  2. Updated signup flow to be conditional:
     - **With invite code**: User profile created → Accept invite (join as MEMBER)
     - **Without invite code**: User profile created → Create household (join as ADMIN)
  3. Added comprehensive logging to track role assignment
- **Verification**:
  - Signup WITHOUT invite: Creates 1 household, user is admin ✓
  - Signup WITH invite: Creates 0 households, user joins existing as member ✓
- **Database Cleanup Needed**: Remove duplicate households and incorrect member records from testing

### Floating Action Button - Enhanced Wallet Creation (2026-01-24)
- Link appears below the Account selector for easy wallet creation
- Allows users to quickly add a wallet without closing the transaction form
- FAB maintains menu with both "Add Transaction" and "Add Account" options

### ARCHITECTURE: Personal Budget Periods (2026-01-24)
- **Changed**: Budget period fields moved from `households` table to `householdMembers` table
- **Reason**: Support different paydays for each household member (e.g., Alexander paid on 25th, Cecilia paid on 10th)
- **New Fields on householdMembers**:
  - `paydayDay`: Number (1-31 or -1 for last day)
  - `payFrequency`: String (default: "monthly")
  - `budgetPeriodStart`: String (ISO YYYY-MM-DD)
  - `budgetPeriodEnd`: String (ISO YYYY-MM-DD)
  - `lastBudgetReset`: Number (timestamp)
  - `monthlyIncome`: Number (for future shared expense splits)
- **New API Function**: `getMemberBudgetPeriod(userId, householdId)` returns member's personal budget period
  - Falls back to household period for backward compatibility
  - Returns `{ start, end, paydayDay, source: 'member' | 'household' }`
- **Payday Settings**: Now sets personal payday on `householdMembers` record (not household)
- **Dashboard**: Shows user's own budget period, not household's
- **Budget Setup/Overview**: Uses personal budget period for budget tracking
- **Transactions**: Budget spent amounts tracked against personal budget period
- **Analytics**: Uses personal payday for date range calculations
- **Invited Members**: Join with budget fields initialized to household's payday (fixes transaction filtering issues)

### BUG FIX: Date Picker and Recent Transactions Widget (2026-01-25)
- **Problem 1**: When editing a transaction, couldn't select today's date (date picker was disabled)
- **Problem 2**: Transactions not appearing in dashboard widget after budget period reset
- **Root Causes**:
  1. Date comparison in edit form used `toISOString()` which converts to UTC, causing timezone mismatches (e.g., local midnight becomes previous day in UTC)
  2. Dashboard widget was filtering transactions by current budget period only, so after payday reset, no transactions appeared (since all previous transactions were from the old period)
  3. API validation used Date object comparison instead of string comparison for YYYY-MM-DD dates
- **The Fixes**:
  - Fixed edit form date picker (`src/app/transactions/[id]/edit.tsx`):
    - Now uses direct string formatting (`YYYY-MM-DD`) instead of `toISOString()`
    - Compares year/month/day components directly instead of Date objects
  - Fixed API date validation (`src/lib/transactions-api.ts`): Uses string comparison for YYYY-MM-DD dates to avoid timezone issues
  - Fixed dashboard recent transactions (`src/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`): Removed budget period filter from recent transactions query - now shows 5 most recent transactions regardless of period
  - Changed `monthSpending` calculation to use `summary.totalSpent` from budget summary instead of calculating from the limited recent transactions list
- **Impact**:
  - Can now select today's date (and any past date) when editing transactions
  - Dashboard widget now shows the 5 most recent transactions regardless of budget period
  - Budget period calculations remain accurate using the budget summary data

### BUG FIX: Member Budget Summary Not Resetting (2026-01-25)
- **Problem**: When a member's budget period resets on payday, the budget summary doesn't update properly
- **Root Causes**:
  1. `resetMemberBudgetPeriod()` was querying budgetSummary by `householdId` and `periodEnd` instead of by `userId`
  2. This could cause the wrong user's budget summary to be updated (or the admin's instead of the member's)
  3. The spent amount fields (`needsSpent`, `wantsSpent`, `savingsSpent`) were being preserved instead of reset to 0
- **The Fix**:
  - Updated `resetMemberBudgetPeriod()` in `src/lib/budget-api.ts`:
    - Now queries budgetSummary by `userId` AND `householdId` (ensures correct member's summary)
    - Adds `userId` to the update transaction
    - Resets all spent fields: `totalSpent: 0`, `needsSpent: 0`, `wantsSpent: 0`, `savingsSpent: 0`
- **Important Note**: Each household member must have set up their own budget via the Budget → Setup page for them to have a budgetSummary. If a member hasn't set up their budget yet, they won't see it reset on payday. They should go to Budget → Setup and enter their income and allocations.
- **Impact**: Budget period resets now work correctly for both admin and member users
  - Budget period calculations remain accurate using the budget summary data

### BUG FIX: Budget Period Reset Not Working Properly (2026-01-25)
- **Problem**: Budget period dates updated on payday but budget amounts (totalSpent) did not reset to 0
- **Root Cause**: Two issues found:
  1. `checkAndResetBudgetIfNeeded()` was called without `userId` parameter, so it fell back to household-level check instead of member's personal period
  2. `resetMemberBudgetPeriod()` function reset individual budget `spentAmount` but didn't reset the `budgetSummary.totalSpent`
- **The Fix**:
  - Updated dashboard (`src/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`) to pass `userId` to `checkAndResetBudgetIfNeeded(householdId, userId)`
  - Updated `resetMemberBudgetPeriod()` in `src/lib/budget-api.ts` to also reset budget summary with `totalSpent: 0`
- **Impact**: On payday, both individual category budgets AND the overall budget summary now correctly reset to 0

### FIX: Budget Reset on Payday Now Works for All Household Members (2026-01-27)

**Issue**: Budget reset was not happening automatically for all household members on their individual paydays.

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. Reset only triggered when each individual member opened the dashboard
2. Changing payday created data inconsistency between `householdMembers`, `budgets`, and `budgetSummary` tables
3. `budgetSummary` table had redundant `periodStart/periodEnd` fields that weren't syncing properly with member data

**Fixes Implemented**:

1. **Automatic Reset for All Members**
   - `checkAndResetBudgetIfNeeded()` now checks ALL active household members, not just the current user
   - When any member opens the dashboard, it triggers resets for all members whose payday has passed
   - Each member's budget resets on their individual payday automatically

2. **Smart Payday Change Behavior**
   - **Set payday to TODAY or past date** → Triggers immediate reset (fresh start with 0 spending)
   - **Set payday to FUTURE date** → Updates period dates and recalculates spending for new period
   - Example scenarios:
     - Set to Day 28 (tomorrow, today is 27th): Shows 0 spending (correct, no future transactions)
     - Set to Day 27 (today): Resets budget to 0 (fresh start)
     - Set to Day 26 (yesterday): Resets budget to 0 (fresh start)

3. **Data Structure Cleanup (Option 1 - Remove Redundancy)**
   - **Source of truth**: `householdMembers` table stores `budgetPeriodStart`, `budgetPeriodEnd`, `paydayDay`
   - **Removed redundant fields**: `budgetSummary.periodStart` and `budgetSummary.periodEnd` no longer used
   - **Benefits**: Eliminates sync issues, single source of truth, cleaner data model
   - `budgetSummary` now only stores: `totalIncome`, `totalAllocated`, `totalSpent`
   - Period dates are always read from `householdMembers` table

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/budget-api.ts`:
  - Updated `checkAndResetBudgetIfNeeded()` to check all household members
  - Updated `getMemberBudgetPeriod()` to find active budgets intelligently
  - Updated `getBudgetSummary()` to query by userId only (no period filter)
  - Updated `saveBudget()` to not set period fields in budgetSummary
  - Updated `resetBudgetPeriod()` and `resetMemberBudgetPeriod()` to not update period fields in budgetSummary
- `src/app/settings/payday.tsx`:
  - Added logic to detect if payday change should trigger reset (when period starts today or in past)
  - Reset scenario: Archives old budgets, creates new budgets with 0 spending, resets summary
  - No-reset scenario: Updates period dates, recalculates spending for new period
  - Removed budgetSummary period updates (no longer needed)

**Data Model**:
```
householdMembers (source of truth):
  - paydayDay
  - budgetPeriodStart
  - budgetPeriodEnd
  - lastBudgetReset
  - monthlyIncome

budgetSummary (aggregates only):
  - totalIncome
  - totalAllocated
  - totalSpent
  ❌ NO period fields (removed redundancy)

budgets (category-level):
  - periodStart (synced with member period)
  - periodEnd (synced with member period)
  - allocatedAmount
  - spentAmount
```

### BUG FIX: Members Can Now Create Categories, Budgets, and Category Groups (2026-01-24)
- **Problem**: Invited members (like Cecilia) couldn't create categories, category groups, or budgets
- **Root Cause**: All creation APIs looked up household using `WHERE createdByUserId = userId`, which only works for admins who created the household
- **The Fix**:
  - Created `household-utils.ts` with helper functions:
    - `getUserHouseholdId(userId)` - Get household via `householdMembers` table
    - `getUserHouseholdIdByEmail(email)` - Get household by email
    - `getUserProfileAndHousehold(email)` - Get both user profile and household ID
  - Updated all screens to use `householdMembers` lookup instead of `households.createdByUserId`:
    - `src/app/settings/category-groups.tsx` - Category group management
    - `src/app/settings/categories.tsx` - Category management
    - `src/app/settings/import.tsx` - CSV import
    - `src/app/settings/export.tsx` - CSV export
    - `src/app/budget/category-group-allocation.tsx` - Budget allocation
- **Result**: Both admins and members can now create and manage household data

### ARCHITECTURE CHANGE: Personal Categories and Category Groups (2026-01-24)
- **Changed**: Categories and category groups are now personal to each user (not shared household-wide)
- **Implementation**:
  - `getCategories(householdId, userId)` filters to show only:
    - Categories created by the user (`createdByUserId = userId`)
    - Categories shared by others (`isShareable = true`)
  - `getCategoryGroups(householdId, userId)` filters to show only:
    - Category groups created by the user (`createdByUserId = userId`)
  - Added `toggleCategorySharing()` function to allow owners to share categories with household
  - Updated all callers of `getCategories()` and `getCategoryGroups()` to pass both `householdId` and `userId`
  - Added `isShareable` parameter to `updateCategory()` function
  - Fixed duplicate check to only check within user's own categories (not household-wide)
  - Added proper error handling in category creation UI
  - **Fixed (2026-01-24)**: Added helpful UI when member tries to add category but has no category groups
    - Shows warning: "You need to create a category group first before adding categories"
    - Provides button to navigate to category groups creation screen
    - Updated validation to provide clearer error message when no groups exist
- **User Experience**:
  - Each user has their own personal categories and category groups
  - Default categories/groups created on signup are personal to that user
  - Users can optionally mark categories as "shareable" to make them visible to other household members
  - Category groups remain personal (cannot be shared)
  - **Important**: Users must create category groups before creating categories
- **Result**:
  - Alexander's categories → Only Alexander sees them
  - Cecilia's categories → Only Cecilia sees them
  - Alexander can create "Groceries" and Cecilia can also create "Groceries" (no conflict)
  - If Alexander marks a category as "shareable" → Cecilia can see and use it
  - Each user manages their own budget category groups independently
  - Members are guided to create category groups first if they try to create categories without groups
- **Future Enhancement**: UI to toggle sharing in category management screen

### FEATURE: True Balance - Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth Tracking (2026-01-25)
- **Feature**: Displays accurate financial position by separating Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth
- **Implementation**:
  - Created `src/lib/balance-api.ts` with `calculateTrueBalance()` function
    - Queries all household accounts and classifies them by type
    - Asset types: Checking, Savings, Cash, Investment (positive balances = good)
    - Liability types: Credit Card (negative balances = debt)
    - Calculates net worth: Assets - Liabilities
  - Created `src/components/TrueBalanceWidget.tsx`
    - Three-section display: Assets, Liabilities, Net Worth
    - Shows individual accounts within each section with balances
    - Asset accounts show with 💰 icon and balance in CHF
    - Liability accounts show with 💳 icon and debt amount (as positive)
    - Net Worth displayed prominently in teal with large text
    - Auto-refreshes every 5 seconds
    - Liabilities section only shows when debt exists
  - Updated dashboard (`src/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`) to use TrueBalanceWidget
    - Replaced old TotalBalanceCard and summary cards
    - Widget positioned after welcome header

- **How It Works**:
  - Credit card expenses recorded immediately affect budget (correct behavior)
  - Credit card debt reduces net worth (correct financial position)
  - Credit card payments are transfers between accounts (don't affect budget)

- **Display Format**:
  - **Assets Section**: Lists all asset accounts with balances, shows total
  - **Liabilities Section**: Lists all credit cards with debt amounts (shown as positive), shows total debt
  - **Net Worth Section**: Large teal card showing true spendable amount (Assets - Liabilities)

- **Example Flow**:
  1. Initial Setup:
     - Checking: 1,000 CHF
     - Credit Card: 0 CHF
     - Net Worth: 1,000 CHF

  2. Spend on Credit Card (100 CHF groceries):
     - Credit card balance: 0 → -100 CHF
     - Dashboard updates:
       - Assets: 1,000 CHF
       - Liabilities: 100 CHF
       - Net Worth: 900 CHF ✓
     - Budget: Groceries -100 CHF ✓

  3. Pay Credit Card Bill (100 CHF transfer):
     - Checking: 1,000 → 900 CHF
     - Credit Card: -100 → 0 CHF
     - Dashboard updates:
       - Assets: 900 CHF
       - Liabilities: 0 CHF (section hidden)
       - Net Worth: 900 CHF ✓
     - Budget: Unchanged (transfer doesn't affect budget) ✓

- **Files Created**:
  - `src/lib/balance-api.ts` - Balance calculation with asset/liability separation
  - `src/components/TrueBalanceWidget.tsx` - Dashboard widget component

- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Integrated TrueBalanceWidget

### BUG FIX: Members Can Now Use Transactions and Budget Setup (2026-01-24)
- **Problem**: Members couldn't access transactions or budget setup screens - they would get errors or be redirected
- **Root Cause**: 7 additional screens were still using the old `households WHERE createdByUserId = userId` pattern which only works for admins
- **The Fix**:
  - Standardized all screens to use `getUserProfileAndHousehold()` helper from `household-utils.ts`:
    - Transaction screens: `src/app/transactions/add.tsx`, `src/app/transactions/[id]/edit.tsx`, `src/app/(tabs)/transactions.tsx`, `src/app/transactions/trends.tsx`
    - Budget screens: `src/app/budget/category-group-allocation.tsx`
    - Settings screens: Already using the helper correctly
  - All screens now look up household via `householdMembers` table instead of `households.createdByUserId`
  - Standardized return structure: `{ userRecord, householdId }` across all screens
  - Added comprehensive logging to category group allocation for debugging member issues
- **Result**:
  - Members can now add and edit transactions
  - Members can access and use budget setup and allocation screens
  - Categories load correctly in transaction forms for members
  - Trends and analytics screens work for members
  - Budget allocation shows member's personal category groups

### BUG FIX: Budget Setup Redirect Issue (2026-01-24)
- **Problem**: Member clicks "Create My First Budget" and gets redirected to dashboard
- **Root Cause**: Budget allocation screen had inconsistent data structure - it was wrapping `householdId` in `household.id` instead of returning it directly
- **The Fix**:
  - Fixed `src/app/budget/category-group-allocation.tsx` to return `{ userRecord, householdId }` directly from helper
  - Changed data access from `householdQuery.data?.household?.id` to `householdQuery.data?.householdId`
  - Added helpful UI that guides members to create category groups if they try to set up budget without them
  - Added console logging for debugging future issues
- **Result**:
  - Members can now access budget allocation screen successfully
  - Budget setup displays correctly with proper category group loading
  - If member has no expense category groups, clear message explains what to do with a button to create them

### BUG FIX: Member Budget Period Reset Not Working (2026-01-25)
- **Problem**: Members' budget period was not resetting on payday (25th), showing old period dates (25/12/25 to 24/01/26) instead of new period (25/01/26 to 24/02/26)
- **Root Cause**: Multiple issues in `resetMemberBudgetPeriod()` and `checkAndResetBudgetIfNeeded()` functions:
  1. `db.queryOnce()` result handling without null/undefined checks - crashes when result is invalid
  2. Using updated member's `budgetPeriodEnd` to query for OLD records - queries fail because old records have OLD period end dates
  3. No error handling for database query failures
- **The Fixes Applied**:
  1. **Saved OLD period end before update**: Store `oldPeriodEnd = member.budgetPeriodEnd` BEFORE updating member record
  2. **Used OLD period end for queries**: Changed budget and budgetSummary queries to use `oldPeriodEnd` instead of `member.budgetPeriodEnd`
  3. **Added null safety checks**: Wrapped all `db.queryOnce()` calls with validation and try-catch blocks to catch query failures
  4. **Added detailed logging**: Each query now logs its result to help debug issues
  5. **Fixed in both functions**:
     - `resetMemberBudgetPeriod()`: Saves old period, archives old budgets, creates new ones with reset spent amounts
     - `checkAndResetBudgetIfNeeded()`: Added null checks before accessing query results
- **Key Changes**:
  - `src/lib/budget-api.ts` line 765: Save `oldPeriodEnd` before update
  - `src/lib/budget-api.ts` line 810: Use `oldPeriodEnd` in budget query
  - `src/lib/budget-api.ts` line 847: Use `oldPeriodEnd` in summary query
  - All `db.queryOnce()` calls now have try-catch and null checks
- **Result**:
  - Members' budgets now reset properly on payday
  - `budgetSummary.periodStart` and `periodEnd` update to new period dates
  - Spent amounts reset to 0 for new period
  - "Days remaining" calculation updates correctly
  - Dashboard shows data from new period instead of old

### BUG FIX: Dynamic Budget Period Calculation (2026-01-27)
- **Problem**: Budget periods were stored in the database and retrieved, causing issues:
  1. Period dates displayed correctly but transactions from within period not showing up
  2. Budget spent amounts wrong because of incorrect period filtering
  3. Changing payday caused immediate reset when it shouldn't
  4. Auto-reset on payday didn't work reliably
- **Root Cause**: The period dates were stored in `householdMembers` table but the transaction filtering logic used these stale stored values instead of dynamically calculating from `paydayDay`.
- **Solution**: Period is now ALWAYS calculated dynamically from `paydayDay`, never stored and retrieved.
- **Implementation**:
  - Created new `src/lib/budget-period-utils.ts` with:
    - `getCurrentBudgetPeriod(paydayDay)` - Always calculates dynamically based on today's date
    - `getPeriodDisplayString(paydayDay)` - Display helper (e.g., "6 Jan – 5 Feb")
    - `isInCurrentPeriod(date, paydayDay)` - Check if a date is in current period
  - Updated `getMemberBudgetPeriod()` in `budget-api.ts`:
    - Now uses dynamic calculation from `paydayDay` instead of stored period dates
    - Returns `daysRemaining` computed dynamically
  - Simplified payday change logic in `settings/payday.tsx`:
    - Just updates `paydayDay` - no complex reset logic needed
    - Period automatically recalculates on next query
  - Updated all budget screens to use new utility:
    - `src/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
    - `src/app/(tabs)/budget/index.tsx`
    - `src/app/(tabs)/budget/setup.tsx`
    - `src/app/budget/index.tsx`
    - `src/app/budget/setup.tsx`
- **Key Changes**:
  - `src/lib/budget-period-utils.ts`: NEW FILE - Dynamic period calculation
  - `src/lib/budget-api.ts`: `getMemberBudgetPeriod()` now uses `getCurrentBudgetPeriod()`
  - `src/app/settings/payday.tsx`: Simplified to just update `paydayDay`
  - Added debug logging to `recalculateBudgetSpentAmounts()` for troubleshooting
- **Result**:
  - Period dates always correct based on current date and payday setting
  - Transactions from current period show up correctly
  - Budget spent amounts calculated from actual transactions in dynamic period
  - Changing payday doesn't cause immediate reset (spent amounts recalculate for new period)
  - On payday, period automatically shifts forward (no manual reset needed)
  - Console logs show period dates and transaction counts for debugging

### FEATURE: Shared Expense Splits (PART 3 OF 4) (2026-01-25)
- **Feature**: Added shared expense controls to transaction form for multi-member households
- **Implementation**:
  - New state variables: `isShared` (boolean), `paidByUserId` (string)
  - New query: Load all active household members for the "Who paid?" selector
  - UI Controls:
    - "Shared Expense" toggle switch (only shows if household has 2+ members)
    - "Who paid?" multi-select buttons (only shows when toggle is ON)
    - Current user is pre-selected as payer by default
  - Updated `CreateTransactionRequest` interface to include:
    - `isShared?: boolean` - Whether this is a shared expense
    - `paidByUserId?: string` - Which household member paid
  - Updated `TransactionResponse` to include `transactionId` for split creation
  - When saving shared transaction:
    - Sets `isShared = true` and `paidByUserId = selected user`
    - Calls `createExpenseSplits()` automatically to create split records
    - Expense splits are calculated based on income ratio from `budgetSummary.totalIncome`
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/app/transactions/add.tsx`:
    - Added `Switch` import for toggle
    - Added household members query
    - Added shared expense state and UI
    - Updated transaction creation to handle shared expenses
  - `src/lib/transactions-api.ts`:
    - Updated `CreateTransactionRequest` interface
    - Updated `TransactionResponse` interface with `transactionId`
    - Updated `createTransaction()` to use request values for `isShared` and `paidByUserId`
    - Updated return statement to include transactionId for split creation
  - `src/components/DashboardWidgets.tsx`:
    - Updated `RecentTransactionsWidget` to show purple "Shared" badge
  - `src/app/(tabs)/transactions.tsx`:
    - Updated transaction list item to show purple "Shared" badge next to amount
- **Visual Feedback**:
  - Shared transactions display purple "Shared" badge in both dashboard widget and transaction list
  - Personal transactions don't show any badge
  - Badge appears next to the transaction amount for easy identification
- **Behavior**:
  - Solo user households: Don't see "Shared Expense" controls (hidden)
  - Multi-member households: See "Shared Expense" toggle
  - Default: Toggle is OFF (personal expense)
  - When toggled ON: "Who paid?" selector appears with all household members
  - User's own name is pre-selected as default payer
  - Can select any household member as the payer
- **Testing**:
  - Test with solo household: No shared controls visible
  - Test with multi-member household:
    - Add personal expense: No splits created, no badge shown
    - Add shared expense as Alexander: Splits created with Alexander as payer, badge shows
    - Add shared expense as Cecilia: Splits created with Cecilia as payer, badge shows
  - Verify splits appear in `shared_expense_splits` table with correct `isPaid` flags
  - Verify split percentages match income ratio
- **Next Steps (PART 4)**:
  - Settle splits UI to mark expenses as paid
  - Settlement logic to transfer money between accounts
  - Debt visualization showing who owes whom

### FEATURE: Debt Balance Widget on Dashboard (PART 4 OF 4) (2026-01-25)
- **Feature**: Real-time debt balance display on dashboard showing inter-household debt
- **Implementation**:
  - New component: `src/components/DebtBalanceWidget.tsx`
  - Displays who owes whom with color-coded amounts (red for owing, green for owed)
  - Auto-refreshes every 5 seconds to stay up-to-date with shared expenses
  - Automatically hidden when:
    - No partner in household (solo user)
    - No shared expenses exist (balance = 0)
    - Data is loading

- **Widget Behavior**:
  - Shows from each user's perspective:
    - Alexander's perspective: "Cecilia owes you 40 CHF" (green) OR "You owe Cecilia 75 CHF" (red)
    - Cecilia's perspective: "You owe Alexander 40 CHF" (red) OR "Alexander owes you 75 CHF" (green)
  - Displays absolute balance (amount that changed hands, not net)
  - Amount shown with 2 decimal places (e.g., 150.00 CHF)

- **Data Flow**:
  1. Query current user profile from users table
  2. Find current user's household via householdMembers
  3. Load all active household members
  4. Find the other household member (partner)
  5. Call `calculateDebtBalance(currentUserId, partnerId)`
  6. Display based on `whoOwesUserId` field:
     - If `whoOwesUserId === currentUserId`: Show "You owe [Partner]" in red
     - Otherwise: Show "[Partner] owes you" in green

- **Files Created/Modified**:
  - `src/components/DebtBalanceWidget.tsx` (NEW):
    - React component using React Query for data fetching
    - Imports `DebtBalance` interface from shared-expenses-api
    - Handles solo user detection (no partner = don't show widget)
    - Handles zero balance (no shared expenses = don't show widget)
    - Auto-refetch every 5 seconds for real-time updates

  - `src/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` (MODIFIED):
    - Added import for DebtBalanceWidget
    - Inserted widget after TotalBalanceCard and ThisMonthSpendingCard
    - Widget renders conditionally (hidden when balance = 0)

- **Visual Design**:
  - Clean card layout matching dashboard aesthetic
  - "Household Balance" header with subtle gray text
  - Large bold amount (3xl font size)
  - Color-coded:
    - Green (#10B981 family) for "money owed to you"
    - Red (#DC2626 family) for "money you owe"
  - Partner's name highlighted in bold
  - Margin: 4 sides (mx-4 mb-4) for consistent spacing

- **Test Scenarios**:
  - **Scenario 1: No Shared Expenses**
    - Widget hidden (balance = 0)

  - **Scenario 2: Alexander Pays 100 CHF Shared Expense**
    - Alexander's dashboard: "Cecilia owes you 40.00 CHF" (green)
    - Cecilia's dashboard: "You owe Alexander 40.00 CHF" (red)

  - **Scenario 3: Multiple Shared Expenses**
    - Alexander paid 100 CHF → Cecilia owes 40 CHF
    - Cecilia paid 50 CHF → Alexander owes 30 CHF
    - Net: Cecilia owes 10 CHF
    - Alexander's dashboard: "Cecilia owes you 10.00 CHF" (green)
    - Cecilia's dashboard: "You owe Alexander 10.00 CHF" (red)

  - **Scenario 4: Split Evenly (Balance Cancels)**
    - Alexander paid 100 CHF → Cecilia owes 40 CHF
    - Cecilia paid 100 CHF → Alexander owes 40 CHF
    - Net: 0 CHF
    - Widget hidden for both users

  - **Scenario 5: Solo User**
    - Only Alexander, no Cecilia
    - Widget doesn't appear (no partner found)

- **Edge Cases Handled**:
  - ✓ Partner not found in household: Widget hidden
  - ✓ Balance exactly 0: Widget hidden
  - ✓ No shared_expense_splits table data: Widget hidden
  - ✓ Unpaid splits only: Only counts unsettled debts (isPaid = false)
  - ✓ Correct perspective for each user: Each sees their own view
  - ✓ Real-time updates: Refetches every 5 seconds

- **Next Steps**:
  - Settlement UI to allow users to mark debts as paid
  - Move money between accounts when settling debt
  - Settlement history/ledger
  - Multiple members (extend beyond 2-person households)

### DEBUG & ENHANCEMENT: Debt Widget Debugging + Split Percentage Display (2026-01-25)
- **Issue 1**: Members not seeing debt widget (debugging needed)
- **Issue 2**: Users want to see split percentages (e.g., "60/40 based on income")

- **Debugging Implementation** (DebtBalanceWidget.tsx):
  - Comprehensive console logging with emoji indicators:
    - 🔍 Query start
    - 👤 User profile found
    - 🏠 Household membership found
    - 👥 Partner found
    - 📊 Split ratios calculated
    - 💰 Debt balance calculated
    - ✅ Query complete
    - ⚠️ Widget hidden (no debt info, balance = 0)
    - ❌ Error states (user not found, no household, no partner, etc.)
  - Logs show:
    - User profile ID and name
    - Current member role
    - Total household members and their IDs
    - Partner name
    - Split ratio percentages for each user
    - Debt balance calculation result
    - Final rendering decision

- **Split Percentage Display**:
  - Widget now shows income-based split percentages in header:
    - "Household Balance" label with "60% / 40%" next to it
    - Shows each user's share of expenses based on income ratio
    - Updates based on `calculateSplitRatio()` result

  - Transaction form shows split preview:
    - Blue box with "Split Preview:" heading
    - Lists each household member with:
      - Their name
      - Split amount in CHF (calculated from total amount × percentage)
      - Percentage of the split
    - Only shows when:
      - Amount is entered and > 0
      - "Shared Expense" toggle is ON
    - Example: "Alexander: 60.00 CHF (60%)"

- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/DebtBalanceWidget.tsx`:
    - Added `calculateSplitRatio` import
    - Updated DebtInfo interface with percentage fields
    - Added detailed console logging (28 log points)
    - Queries split ratios from budgetSummary income data
    - Displays percentages in widget header
    - Added footer text: "Shared expenses split based on income ratio"

  - `src/app/transactions/add.tsx`:
    - Added `calculateSplitRatio` import
    - New query: `splitRatiosQuery` to fetch split percentages
    - Split preview UI in blue box before "Who paid?" selector
    - Shows split amount and percentage for each member
    - Dynamically updates as amount changes

- **Console Log Reference** (for debugging member visibility):
  ```
  🔍 DebtBalanceWidget: Starting query for [email]
  👤 User profile: [userId] [userName]
  🏠 Current member: [memberId] Role: [role] Household: [householdId]
  👥 Total household members: [count]
     - [userId1] Role: [role]
     - [userId2] Role: [role]
  👥 Partner found: [partnerName]
  📊 Calculating split ratios for household: [householdId]
  📊 Split ratios returned: [array]
  📊 Current user split: [percentage]%
  📊 Other user split: [percentage]%
  💰 Calculating debt balance between [userId1] and [userId2]
  💰 Debt balance result: [balance]
  ✅ DebtBalanceWidget query complete: [debtInfo]
  🎨 Rendering DebtBalanceWidget: hasData=[bool], amount=[num], showWidget=[bool]
  ⚠️ Widget hidden: No debt info
  ⚠️ Widget hidden: Balance is 0
  ```

- **Testing Checklist**:
  - ✓ Alexander opens dashboard → Widget shows with split percentages
  - ✓ Cecilia opens dashboard → Check console logs for any "❌" errors
  - ✓ Both see correct amounts from their perspective
  - ✓ Split preview shows in transaction form when creating shared expense
  - ✓ Split percentages update based on income ratio
  - ✓ Console shows all debug logs without errors

- **Known Issues & Solutions**:
  - If widget doesn't show for Cecilia:
    - Check console for "❌ No user profile found" → email lookup issue
    - Check for "❌ No household membership found" → householdMembers query issue
    - Check for "❌ No partner found in household" → only 1 member in household
  - If split preview shows "50%" → income data not in budgetSummary (use default)
  - If widget shows but amount is 0 → no shared_expense_splits yet (expected)

### FEATURE: Settlement with Transaction Record (PART 5) (2026-01-25)
- **Feature**: Settle shared expense debts by creating settlement transactions and updating account balances
- **User Flow**:
  1. User views Debt Balance Widget showing "You owe [Partner] 150 CHF"
  2. User taps "Settle Debt" button (red button, only shows when user owes)
  3. Settlement Modal opens with:
     - Settlement amount displayed prominently in red box
     - List of payer's accounts to choose from (debit account)
     - List of receiver's accounts to choose from (credit account)
     - First account auto-selected for both
     - Warning if payer account has insufficient balance
  4. User confirms by tapping "Pay [amount] CHF" button
  5. On success:
     - Settlement transaction created (type="settlement")
     - Payer account balance decreased by settlement amount
     - Receiver account balance increased by settlement amount
     - All unpaid splits between payer and receiver marked as paid (isPaid=true)
     - Alert shows success: "Payment of 150.00 CHF has been recorded"
     - Modal closes
     - Widget disappears (balance now 0)

- **Implementation Details**:

  **New File**: `src/lib/settlement-api.ts`
  - Function: `createSettlement(payerUserId, receiverUserId, amount, payerAccountId, receiverAccountId, householdId)`
  - Step 1: Creates settlement transaction record:
    - type: "settlement" (special transaction type)
    - amount: Settlement amount in CHF
    - note: "Debt settlement: [amount] CHF to [receiverUserId]"
    - isShared: false (settlement is not a shared expense)
    - paidByUserId: payerUserId
  - Step 2: Updates both account balances (atomic transaction):
    - Debits payer account: `balance - amount`
    - Credits receiver account: `balance + amount`
  - Step 3: Marks unpaid splits as paid:
    - Finds all splits where `owerUserId === payerUserId` AND `owedToUserId === receiverUserId` AND `isPaid === false`
    - Updates each split: `isPaid: true`
  - Returns: `{ settlementId, transactionId, amount, splitsSettled }`
  - Comprehensive logging at each step for debugging

  **New Component**: `src/components/SettlementModal.tsx`
  - Modal properties: visible, onClose, amount, receiverUserId, receiverName
  - Account Selection:
    - Queries payer's accounts (from current user)
    - Queries receiver's accounts (from receiverUserId)
    - Shows account name with current balance
    - Warns if payer account balance < settlement amount
    - Allows overdraft with confirmation
  - UI Elements:
    - Red header box: "Settle Debt" title with close button
    - Amount box: Shows settlement amount in red with receiver name
    - Two account sections: Payer's accounts and Receiver's accounts
    - Summary box: Shows from/to account names and settlement amount
    - Action buttons:
      - "Pay [amount] CHF" button (disabled until accounts selected)
      - "Cancel" button (secondary)
  - Success Flow:
    - On settlement creation success:
      - Invalidates queries: ['debt-balance'], ['accounts'], ['transactions'], ['payer-accounts'], ['receiver-accounts']
      - Shows success alert with amount
      - Clears account selections
      - Closes modal
      - Dashboard automatically refreshes to show widget hidden (balance = 0)

  **Modified File**: `src/components/DebtBalanceWidget.tsx`
  - New state: `showSettlement` (boolean)
  - New import: `SettlementModal` component
  - New constant: `receiverUserId` (determines who receives payment)
  - Added "Settle Debt" button:
    - Only shows when user owes (youOwe === true)
    - Tapping opens settlement modal
    - Red button for visual emphasis (matching debt color)
  - Added SettlementModal component at bottom:
    - Only renders when showSettlement === true
    - Passes correct amount, receiverUserId, and receiverName

- **Database Changes**:
  - Transactions table already supports `type="settlement"`
  - SharedExpenseSplits table already has `isPaid` flag for marking settled debts

- **Test Scenarios**:
  - **Scenario 1: Simple Settlement**
    - Alexander owes Cecilia 50 CHF (from 1 shared expense split)
    - Alexander taps "Settle Debt"
    - Selects his Checking account to pay, Cecilia's Savings account to receive
    - Taps "Pay 50.00 CHF"
    - Settlement transaction created
    - Both accounts updated
    - Split marked as paid
    - Widget disappears

  - **Scenario 2: Multiple Splits Settlement**
    - Alexander owes Cecilia 100 CHF total (from 3 different shared expenses)
    - Alexander settles for 100 CHF
    - All 3 splits marked as paid
    - Widget disappears

  - **Scenario 3: Insufficient Balance Warning**
    - Alexander's Checking account has 30 CHF balance
    - Alexander owes Cecilia 50 CHF
    - Selects Checking account as payer
    - Warning appears: "Account balance (30.00 CHF) is less than settlement amount (50.00 CHF). Continue anyway?"
    - Alexander can choose to continue (overdraft) or select different account

  - **Scenario 4: Settlement Appears in Transaction History**
    - Settlement transaction should appear in:
      - Recent Transactions widget on dashboard
      - Full Transaction list (/transactions tab)
      - Transaction type: "settlement" (special category indicator)
    - Can be viewed/edited like normal transactions

- **Edge Cases Handled**:
  - ✓ Multiple accounts to choose from: Both payer and receiver can select from their accounts
  - ✓ Account balance too low: Warning shown but overdraft allowed
  - ✓ No accounts available: Modal shows error or disables buttons
  - ✓ Settlement during pending mutation: Button disabled until complete
  - ✓ Modal cancellation: Modal closes, settlement not created
  - ✓ Multiple settlements: Can settle multiple times, each creates new transaction

- **Files Created/Modified**:
  - `src/lib/settlement-api.ts` (NEW) - Settlement transaction creation logic
  - `src/components/SettlementModal.tsx` (NEW) - Settlement UI component
  - `src/components/DebtBalanceWidget.tsx` (MODIFIED) - Added settlement button and modal

- **Next Steps**:
  - Settlement UI for reversed debts (when user is owed money) - currently only shows settle button when owing
  - Settlement history/ledger showing all past settlements
  - Batch settlements for multiple household members
  - Settlement notifications/confirmations

### BUG FIX: Cascade Delete Shared Expense Splits (2026-01-25)
- **Problem**: When deleting a shared transaction, the associated expense splits remained in the database orphaned
  - This caused the debt widget to show incorrect balances
  - Deleting transactions that created debt would not properly settle the debt
  - Orphaned splits would be recalculated, showing phantom debts

- **Root Cause**: `deleteTransaction()` only deleted the transaction record, not the related splits in `shared_expense_splits` table

- **The Fix**:
  - Updated `deleteTransaction()` in `src/lib/transactions-api.ts` to:
    1. Query for all shared expense splits associated with the transaction
    2. Include split deletion operations in the atomic database transaction
    3. Delete splits before deleting the transaction (proper cascade order)
    4. Log the number of splits deleted for debugging
  - Code change:
    ```typescript
    // Check for associated shared expense splits
    const splitsResult = await db.queryOnce({
      shared_expense_splits: {
        $: { where: { transactionId: transactionId } }
      }
    });

    const splits = splitsResult.data?.shared_expense_splits || [];

    // Build delete operations: splits first, then transaction
    const deleteOperations = [
      ...splits.map(split => db.tx.shared_expense_splits[split.id].delete()),
      db.tx.transactions[transactionId].delete(),
      db.tx.accounts[transaction.accountId].update({ ... })
    ];

    await db.transact(deleteOperations);
    ```

- **Impact**:
  - Deleting shared transactions now removes associated debt splits
  - Debt widget correctly updates after transaction deletion (balance recalculates)
  - No orphaned splits left in database
  - Debt calculations remain accurate across all users

- **Test Scenario**:
  1. Alexander creates shared transaction: 100 CHF (Alexander pays)
  2. Debt widget shows: "Cecilia owes you 40 CHF"
  3. Alexander deletes the transaction
  4. Debt widget updates: Widget disappears (balance = 0)
  5. Verify database: No splits exist for deleted transaction

### DEBUG: Settlement Visibility and Split Updates (2026-01-25)
- **Purpose**: Add comprehensive logging to verify settlement transactions are created correctly and splits are marked as paid
- **Implementation**: Enhanced `createSettlement()` with detailed logging at each step

- **Logging Added**:
  - Settlement creation start: Logs payer, receiver, amount, account IDs
  - Transaction creation: Confirms settlement transaction created with correct ID
  - Transaction verification: Verifies transaction exists in database with correct type and amount
  - Account updates: Shows balances before and after settlement
  - Split filtering: Logs detailed info for each split (IDs, user IDs, isPaid status)
  - Split updates: Confirms each split marked as paid
  - Completion: Settlement complete summary

- **Transaction Type Support**:
  - Updated `Transaction` interface to include `type: 'income' | 'expense' | 'settlement'`
  - Transaction list filter now includes settlement transactions in all views
  - Settlement transactions display with purple color (#8B5CF6)
  - Settlement transactions show "Settlement" badge in transaction list and dashboard

- **UI Improvements**:
  - Dashboard widget shows purple "Settlement" badge for settlement transactions
  - Transaction list shows "Settlement" badge with purple styling
  - Settlement transactions use purple icon and color (#8B5CF6)
  - Amount display for settlements shows no prefix (no +/- sign)
  - Category name shows "Settlement" if not set

- **Edit Prevention**:
  - Settlement transactions cannot be edited through the edit screen
  - Attempting to edit settlement shows alert: "Settlement transactions cannot be edited"
  - User can delete settlement and create new one if needed

- **Type Safety**:
  - `getTransactionTypeColor()` now accepts 'settlement' type
  - Returns purple color for settlement transactions
  - Handles all three transaction types consistently

- **Console Log Format**:
  ```
  💳 === SETTLEMENT START ===
  - Payer: [userId]
  - Receiver: [userId]
  - Amount: [amount]
  - Payer Account: [accountId]
  - Receiver Account: [accountId]
  - Household: [householdId]

  📝 Creating settlement transaction...
  ✅ Settlement transaction created: [settlementId]

  🔍 Transaction verified: { id: ..., type: settlement, amount: ..., userId: ... }

  💰 Updating account balances...
  💰 Before balance update:
    Payer balance: [amount]
    Receiver balance: [amount]
  💰 After balance update:
    Payer new balance: [amount]
    Receiver new balance: [amount]

  📊 Marking splits as paid...
  📊 Total splits in household: [count]
  📊 Total shared transactions: [count]
  📊 Splits to settle: [count]
    - Split [id]: owerUserId=[id], owedToUserId=[id], isPaid=false, matches=true
  ✅ All splits marked as paid

  💳 === SETTLEMENT COMPLETE ===
  ```

- **Test Steps**:
  1. Create shared expense: 100 CHF, Alexander pays
  2. Check console: Settlement logs appear in LOGS tab
  3. Check debt widget: Shows owed amount
  4. User clicks "Settle Debt"
  5. Check console logs for:
     - "Settlement transaction created"
     - "Transaction verified" with correct type
     - Account balances before/after
     - "Splits to settle: 1"
     - "All splits marked as paid"
  6. Check Alexander's transaction list: Shows original expense + settlement
  7. Check Cecilia's transaction list: Shows settlement received
  8. Check debt widget: Disappears (balance = 0)

- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/lib/settlement-api.ts` - Enhanced logging with transaction verification
  - `src/lib/transactions-api.ts` - Added 'settlement' to Transaction type
  - `src/lib/dashboard-helpers.ts` - Updated getTransactionTypeColor to handle settlement
  - `src/app/(tabs)/transactions.tsx` - Settlement badge and type filtering
  - `src/components/DashboardWidgets.tsx` - Settlement badge display
  - `src/app/transactions/[id]/edit.tsx` - Prevent settlement editing

### BUG FIX: Show ALL Household Transactions, Not Just User's Own (2026-01-25)
- **Problem**: Settlement transactions only visible to payer, not receiver
  - Alexander settles debt, settlement only appears in his transaction list
  - Cecilia doesn't see Alexander's settlement in her transaction list
  - Caused confusion about whether settlement was processed
  - Both users couldn't see complete household transaction history

- **Root Cause**: Transaction list query filtered by `userId`, showing only current user's transactions
  - `WHERE userId = currentUserId` excluded partner's transactions entirely
  - Settlement transactions had payer's userId, so receiver never saw them

- **The Fix**:
  - Changed transaction list query from user-specific to household-wide
  - Created new API function: `getHouseholdTransactionsWithCreators(householdId)`
  - Function returns all transactions for the household with creator names enriched
  - Updated transaction list interface to include `creatorName` field
  - Display logic shows creator name only for transactions created by other user
  - Updated all query keys and invalidations to use household ID instead of user ID

- **Code Changes**:
  ```typescript
  // OLD (user-specific):
  const transactionsQuery = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['transactions', householdQuery.data?.userRecord?.id],
    queryFn: async () => {
      return getUserTransactions(householdQuery.data.userRecord.id);
    },
    enabled: !!householdQuery.data?.userRecord?.id,
  });

  // NEW (household-wide):
  const transactionsQuery = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['transactions-household', householdQuery.data?.householdId],
    queryFn: async () => {
      return getHouseholdTransactionsWithCreators(householdQuery.data.householdId);
    },
    enabled: !!householdQuery.data?.householdId,
  });
  ```

- **New API Function**:
  ```typescript
  export async function getHouseholdTransactionsWithCreators(
    householdId: string
  ): Promise<TransactionWithCreator[]> {
    // Queries all transactions in household
    // Joins with users table to get creator names
    // Returns enriched transactions with creatorName field
  }
  ```

- **Creator Name Display**:
  - Shows creator name next to category only for other user's transactions
  - Format: "Category Name (Alexander)" for transactions created by Alexander
  - Own transactions show no creator name (cleaner, less clutter)
  - Helps identify who created shared expenses and settlements

- **Visual Example**:
  ```
  Alexander's View:
  - 100 CHF Groceries (Shared) ← His own expense
  - 38.6 CHF Settlement (Cecilia) ← Cecilia settled to him

  Cecilia's View:
  - 100 CHF Groceries (Shared) (Alexander) ← Alexander paid
  - 38.6 CHF Settlement ← Her own settlement
  ```

- **Impact**:
  - Both users see complete household transaction history
  - Settlement transactions visible to both payer and receiver
  - Shared expenses visible to both participants
  - Better transparency and reconciliation
  - Can verify settlements were processed
  - Can see who created each transaction

- **Test Scenario**:
  1. Alexander creates 100 CHF shared expense
  2. Alexander's list: "100 CHF Groceries (Shared)"
  3. Cecilia's list: "100 CHF Groceries (Shared) (Alexander)"
  4. Cecilia settles 38.6 CHF via modal
  5. Alexander's list: "100 CHF Groceries (Shared)" + "38.6 CHF Settlement (Cecilia)"
  6. Cecilia's list: "100 CHF Groceries (Shared) (Alexander)" + "38.6 CHF Settlement"
  7. Both users see complete transaction history
  8. Debt widget disappears for both (balance = 0)

- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/lib/transactions-api.ts` - Added getHouseholdTransactionsWithCreators function
  - `src/app/(tabs)/transactions.tsx` - Updated to use household query with creator names, show creator names for other users' transactions

### REVISED FEATURE: Settlement as Internal Account Transfer (2026-01-25)

### ENHANCEMENT: Batch Settlement Support & Settlement Tracking (2026-01-28)
- **Feature**: Enhanced settlement workflow to support batch settlements and comprehensive tracking
- **Database Schema Updates**:

  **Transactions Table** - Added settlement tracking fields:
  - `settled: boolean` - Marks if transaction has been settled (default: false)
  - `settledAt: number` - Timestamp when transaction was settled
  - `settlementId: string` - Links transaction to settlement record

  **Settlements Table** - Enhanced with batch support:
  - `paymentMethod: string` - How settlement was made (e.g., 'internal_transfer', 'cash')
  - `settledExpenses: JSON` - Array of transaction IDs that were settled together
  - `createdAt: number` - Timestamp when settlement was created

- **API Functions** (`src/lib/settlement-api.ts`):

  **`getUnsettledSharedExpenses(householdId, currentUserId)`**
  - Returns ALL unsettled shared expenses for a user
  - Filters out transactions marked as `settled: true`
  - Returns `UnsettledExpense[]` with full details:
    - Transaction ID, date, category, amounts
    - Who paid, description
    - Your share (positive = you owe, negative = you're owed)
  - Sorted by date (newest first)

  **`calculateHouseholdDebt(householdId, currentUserId)`**
  - Calculates total net debt between household members
  - Returns `DebtSummary`:
    - `amount`: Total debt (positive = you owe, negative = you're owed)
    - `otherMemberId`, `otherMemberName`, `otherMemberEmail`
  - Uses unsettled expenses to compute balance

  **`getUnsettledExpensesByDirection(householdId, currentUserId)`**
  - Groups expenses by direction (what you owe vs what you're owed)
  - Returns separated lists:
    - `youOwe: UnsettledExpense[]` - Expenses where you owe money
    - `youAreOwed: UnsettledExpense[]` - Expenses where you're owed money
    - `totalYouOwe`, `totalYouAreOwed`, `netDebt` - Summary totals

  **`createSettlement()` - Enhanced**
  - Now tracks which transactions are being settled
  - Updates transactions with settlement fields:
    - Sets `settled: true`
    - Records `settledAt` timestamp
    - Links to `settlementId`
  - Updates settlement record with `settledExpenses` array
  - Maintains split tracking (`isPaid: true`) for compatibility

- **Settlement Workflow**:
  1. User views all unsettled expenses via `getUnsettledSharedExpenses()`
  2. System calculates total debt via `calculateHouseholdDebt()`
  3. User initiates settlement
  4. `createSettlement()` processes:
     - Transfers money between accounts
     - Marks all related transactions as settled
     - Updates splits as paid
     - Records settlement with transaction IDs
  5. Future queries filter out settled transactions

- **Key Benefits**:
  - **Batch Settlement**: Can settle multiple expenses at once
  - **Settlement History**: Track which expenses were settled together
  - **Prevent Double Settlement**: Settled transactions excluded from future debt calculations
  - **Audit Trail**: Complete record of what was settled and when
  - **Flexible Queries**: Can show settled vs unsettled expenses separately

- **Database Migration Notes**:
  - Existing transactions default to `settled: false` (unsettled)
  - Old settlements work but don't have `settledExpenses` array (optional field)
  - System is backward compatible with existing data


- **Architecture Change**: Settlement is now an internal account transfer, NOT a transaction
  - Previous approach: Created settlement transaction (incorrectly affected budgets)
  - New approach: Transfer money between accounts + log settlement history + mark splits paid
  - Reason: Settlement is reconciliation, not a new economic event

- **What Settlement Does**:
  1. Transfers money from payer account to receiver account
  2. Logs transfer in settlements table for history
  3. Marks shared expense splits as paid
  4. Does NOT create a transaction (budgets unaffected!)

- **Database Schema Changes**:
  - Added new `settlements` table in `src/lib/db.ts`:
    ```typescript
    settlements: {
      id: string,
      householdId: string,
      payerUserId: string,      // Who paid
      receiverUserId: string,   // Who received
      amount: number,           // Amount in CHF
      payerAccountId: string,   // Account debited
      receiverAccountId: string,// Account credited
      note: string,             // Optional note
      settledAt: number,        // Timestamp
      createdAt: number
    }
    ```

- **Updated Settlement API** (`src/lib/settlement-api.ts`):
  - `createSettlement()` now:
    - Step 1: Fetches current account balances
    - Step 2: Updates both accounts (debit payer, credit receiver)
    - Step 3: Logs settlement in settlements table
    - Step 4: Marks unpaid splits as paid
    - Returns: settlementId, amount, new balances, splits settled count
  - Added `getSettlementHistory()` function to retrieve settlement records with user names

- **Key Difference from Previous**:
  - ❌ NO transaction created (no type='settlement')
  - ❌ NOT visible in transaction list
  - ❌ Does NOT affect budget spent amounts
  - ✅ Accounts updated correctly
  - ✅ Settlement logged in settlements table
  - ✅ Splits marked as paid

- **Console Logging**:
  ```
  💳 === SETTLEMENT START (INTERNAL TRANSFER) ===
  - Payer: [userId]
  - Receiver: [userId]
  - Amount: [amount]
  - Payer Account: [accountId]
  - Receiver Account: [accountId]

  💰 Fetching account balances...
  💰 Current balances:
    Payer: [balance]
    Receiver: [balance]

  💰 Updating account balances (internal transfer)...
  💰 New balances:
    Payer: [newBalance]
    Receiver: [newBalance]

  📝 Logging settlement in settlements table...
  📝 Settlement logged: [settlementId]

  📊 Marking splits as paid...
  📊 Splits to mark as paid: [count]
  ✅ All splits marked as paid

  ```

- **Test Scenario**:
  1. Alexander pays 100 CHF groceries (shared, 61.4%/38.6% split)
     - Transaction shows: 100 CHF
     - Debt: Cecilia owes 38.6 CHF
  2. Cecilia settles 38.6 CHF
     - Settlement created in settlements table
     - Cecilia's account: -38.6 CHF
     - Alexander's account: +38.6 CHF
     - Splits marked as paid
     - **Transaction amount reduced: 100 → 61.4 CHF** (Alexander's portion only)
  3. After settlement:
     - Transaction now shows: 61.4 CHF (only Alexander's portion!) ✓
     - Alexander's budget: 61.4 CHF (his actual expense) ✓
     - Debt widget disappears ✓

- **Key Feature: Transaction Amount Reduction**:
  - When a split is settled, the original transaction amount is REDUCED
  - Formula: `newAmount = originalAmount - settledSplitAmount`
  - Example: 100 CHF shared expense → Cecilia settles 38.6 CHF → Transaction becomes 61.4 CHF
  - This ensures the transaction only shows the payer's actual portion after settlement

- **Comparison**:
  ```
  OLD APPROACH (BROKEN):
  - Creates settlement transaction
  - Shows in transaction list
  - Original transaction stays at 100 CHF
  - Budget shows 100 CHF (wrong!)

  NEW APPROACH (CORRECT):
  - Internal account transfer
  - Hidden from transaction list
  - Original transaction reduced to 61.4 CHF
  - Budget shows 61.4 CHF (correct!) ✓
  ```

- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/lib/db.ts` - Added settlements table
  - `src/lib/settlement-api.ts` - Revised to use account transfer approach + reduce transaction amounts
  - `src/lib/transactions-api.ts` - Removed 'settlement' from Transaction type
  - `src/app/(tabs)/transactions.tsx` - Removed settlement transaction filtering and display
  - `src/components/DashboardWidgets.tsx` - Removed settlement badges and color handling
  - `src/lib/dashboard-helpers.ts` - Removed settlement color handling
  - `src/app/transactions/[id]/edit.tsx` - Removed settlement edit prevention

### FEATURE: Payee/Merchant Field with Smart Category Learning (2026-01-25)
- **Feature**: Added smart payee-category learning system that auto-fills categories based on previous usage
- **Privacy**: Payees and mappings are **personal to each user** (like categories) - not shared across household
- **How It Works**:
  1. **First Use**: User enters "Migros" → Manually selects "Groceries" → Mapping saved to their account
  2. **Second Use**: User enters "Migros" → "Groceries" auto-fills ✨
  3. **Learning**: If user changes category, mapping updates for next time
  4. **Personal**: Each user has their own payees and mappings

- **Database**:
  - Added `payee_category_mappings` table
  - Fields: userId (personal to user), payee (normalized lowercase for matching), displayName (original capitalization), categoryId, lastUsedAt, usageCount, timestamps
  - One mapping per payee per user (unique constraint)
  - displayName preserves user's original capitalization

- **Implementation**:
  - Created `src/lib/payee-mappings-api.ts` with learning logic:
    - `getCategorySuggestion(userId, payee)`: Looks up category for a payee
    - `savePayeeMapping(userId, payee, categoryId)`: Saves or updates payee-category association
  - Updated Add Transaction form with smart auto-fill:
    - Payee input triggers category suggestion
    - Modal picker shows only user's payees
  - Updated Edit Transaction form:
    - Saves updated mapping when category changes
    - Allows learning from edited transactions

- **UI/UX Features**:
  - **Smart Auto-Fill**: Category fills automatically when payee entered
  - **Personal Payees**: Each user sees only their own payees (like categories)
  - **Preserves Capitalization**: Shows payees exactly as you created them (e.g., "MIGROS" if created as "MIGROS")
  - **Case Insensitive Matching**: "Migros" = "migros" = "MIGROS" for lookups, but displays as originally created
  - **Whitespace Handling**: "Migros " = "Migros"
  - **Non-Invasive**: Can override auto-filled category anytime

- **Capitalization Examples**:
  ```
  Create "STARBUCKS" → Shows "STARBUCKS" in picker
  Create "netflix" → Shows "netflix" in picker
  Create "Amazon Prime" → Shows "Amazon Prime" in picker
  Entry "starbucks" matches and displays as "STARBUCKS"
  Entry "NETFLIX" matches and displays as "netflix"
  ```

- **Example Flows**:
  ```
  Test 1 - First Time:
  1. Enter "Migros"
  2. No auto-fill (first time)
  3. Select "Groceries"
  4. Save → Mapping created: "migros" → Groceries (saved to your account)

  Test 2 - Second Time:
  1. Enter "Migros"
  2. Category auto-fills to "Groceries" ✨
  3. Save → Usage count increments

  Test 3 - Different Users:
  1. Alexander adds "Migros" → "Groceries"
  2. Cecilia adds "Migros" → "Shopping" (her preference)
  3. Each user's payee list is independent
  ```

- **Edge Cases Handled**:
  - Empty payee: No mapping created
  - No category selected: No mapping saved
  - Transaction without payee: Works normally
  - First time payee: No auto-fill (learns on save)
  - Personal privacy: Each user's payees are private

- **Files Created**:
  - `src/lib/payee-mappings-api.ts` - Smart learning logic
  - `src/components/PayeePickerModal.tsx` - Full-screen modal picker

- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/lib/db.ts` - Added payee_category_mappings table (userId field)
  - `src/app/transactions/add.tsx` - Modal picker with smart auto-fill (userId-based)
  - `src/app/transactions/[id]/edit.tsx` - Modal picker with learning from edits (userId-based)

### FEATURE: Payee Picker Modal with Search and Create (2026-01-25)

    - Replaced inline TextInput with Pressable button
    - Opens modal on tap
    - Shows selected payee or "Choose payee..."
    - Clear button when payee selected
    - Category auto-fills on selection
  - Updated Edit Transaction form:
    - Same modal picker pattern
    - Pre-selects current payee

  4. Type "Star" in search
  5. No matches found
  6. Tap "Create 'Starbucks'" button
  7. Payee filled, modal closes
  8. Category auto-fills if mapping exists ✨
  ```

- **Benefits**:
  - **Faster Entry**: Quick access to YOUR payees with alphabetical sorting
  - **Easy to Find**: A-Z sorting makes it easy to locate specific payees
  - **Consistent Naming**: See existing payees to avoid duplicates (no "Migros" vs "MIGROS")

  6. CSV export: Includes payee column ✓

### FEATURE: True Balance - Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth Tracking (2026-01-25)
- **Feature**: Displays accurate financial position by separating Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth
- **IMPORTANT**: Accounts/wallets are personal to each user (not household-wide)
  - Each user sees only their own accounts in the True Balance widget
  - Alexander's checking account ≠ Cecilia's checking account
  - Net Worth is calculated per user, not per household
- **Implementation**:
  - Created `src/lib/balance-api.ts` with `calculateTrueBalance(userId)` function
    - Queries user's personal accounts only (filtered by userId)
    - Asset types: Checking, Savings, Cash, Investment (positive balances = good)
    - Liability types: Credit Card (negative balances = debt)
    - Calculates net worth: Assets - Liabilities
  - Created `src/components/TrueBalanceWidget.tsx`
    - Three-section display: Assets, Liabilities, Net Worth
    - Shows individual accounts within each section with balances
    - Asset accounts show with 💰 icon and balance in CHF
    - Liability accounts show with 💳 icon and debt amount (as positive)
    - Net Worth displayed prominently in teal with large text
    - Auto-refreshes every 5 seconds
    - Liabilities section only shows when debt exists
  - Updated dashboard (`src/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`) to use TrueBalanceWidget
    - Replaced old TotalBalanceCard and summary cards
    - Widget positioned after welcome header

- **How It Works**:
  - Credit card expenses recorded immediately affect budget (correct behavior)
  - Credit card debt reduces net worth (correct financial position)
  - Credit card payments are transfers between accounts (don't affect budget)

- **Display Format**:
  - **Assets Section**: Lists all user's asset accounts with balances, shows total
  - **Liabilities Section**: Lists all user's credit cards with debt amounts (shown as positive), shows total debt
  - **Net Worth Section**: Large teal card showing user's true spendable amount (Assets - Liabilities)

- **Example Flow** (for a single user):
  1. Initial Setup:
     - Checking: 1,000 CHF
     - Credit Card: 0 CHF
     - Net Worth: 1,000 CHF

  2. Spend on Credit Card (100 CHF groceries):
     - Credit card balance: 0 → -100 CHF
     - Dashboard updates:
       - Assets: 1,000 CHF
       - Liabilities: 100 CHF
       - Net Worth: 900 CHF ✓
     - Budget: Groceries -100 CHF ✓

  3. Pay Credit Card Bill (100 CHF transfer):
     - Checking: 1,000 → 900 CHF
     - Credit Card: -100 → 0 CHF
     - Dashboard updates:
       - Assets: 900 CHF
       - Liabilities: 0 CHF (section hidden)
       - Net Worth: 900 CHF ✓
     - Budget: Unchanged (transfer doesn't affect budget) ✓

- **Files Created**:
  - `src/lib/balance-api.ts` - Balance calculation with asset/liability separation (per user)
  - `src/components/TrueBalanceWidget.tsx` - Dashboard widget component

- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Integrated TrueBalanceWidget

### FEATURE: Category Picker Modal with Search and Usage Stats (2026-01-25)

- **UI/UX Improvements**:
  - **Full-Screen Modal**: Dedicated search and selection interface
  - **Search Bar**: Search categories in real-time with instant filtering
  - **Budget Remaining Display**: Shows remaining budget for each category (e.g., "CHF 45.50")
  - **Sorted by Budget**: Categories with most remaining budget appear first
  - **Friendly Group Names**: Category group labels show friendly names (Needs/Wants/Savings) instead of system IDs (custom_...)
  - **Icons**: Shows category icons for visual scanning
  - **Large Touch Targets**: 56px height buttons for mobile-friendly interaction
  - **Current Selection Highlighted**: Selected category shows in teal with border

- **Implementation**:
  - Created `CategoryPickerModal.tsx` component:
    - Full-screen modal with slide animation
    - Search functionality with real-time filtering
    - Loads user's personal categories (not household-wide)
    - Fetches current budget period and budget details for each category
    - Calculates budget remaining (allocatedAmount - spentAmount)
    - Maps category group IDs to friendly names (Needs, Wants, Savings) via getCategoryGroups API
    - Sorts by budget remaining descending (most budget first), then alphabetically
    - Shows friendly category group names as subtitles
    - Filters categories by transaction type (income vs expense)
  - Updated Add Transaction form:
    - Replaced inline category dropdown with modal button
    - Button shows "Select category" or selected category name
    - Opens full-screen modal on tap
    - Closes modal after selection
  - Updated Edit Transaction form:
    - Same modal picker pattern
    - Pre-selects current category
    - Maintains existing functionality

- **Example Flow**:
  ```
  1. Open Add Transaction form
  2. Tap "Select category" button (in Category field)
  3. Full-screen modal opens with search bar
  4. See all categories sorted by budget remaining:
     - "Groceries (CHF 245.50)" [Needs] ← most budget left
     - "Shopping (CHF 150.75)" [Wants]
     - "Entertainment (CHF 89.25)" [Wants]
     - "Utilities (CHF 45.00)" [Needs]
  5. Search: Type "groc" → filters to show only "Groceries"
  6. Tap "Groceries" → Modal closes, category selected
  7. Form shows "Groceries" in category field
  ```

- **Benefits**:
  - **Smart Prioritization**: Categories with more remaining budget appear first (helps allocate spending)
  - **Budget Awareness**: See exactly how much budget is left per category
  - **Clean UI**: Friendly category group names (Needs/Wants/Savings) instead of system IDs
  - **Easy Discovery**: Search filters long category lists instantly
  - **Visual Context**: Icons and category groups help identification
  - **Mobile-Optimized**: Full-screen modal with large touch targets
  - **Type Safety**: Only shows relevant categories for income/expense

- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/app/transactions/add.tsx` - Replaced inline dropdown with modal picker
  - `src/app/transactions/[id]/edit.tsx` - Same modal picker pattern

### FEATURE: Removed Income/Expenses Summary Cards (2026-01-25)
- **Feature**: Removed the two summary cards (Income and Expenses) from the top of the Transactions tab
- **Reason**: Streamlined the UI for a cleaner, simpler transactions list view
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/app/(tabs)/transactions.tsx` - Removed the summary cards section

### FEATURE: Expense Splitting Settings - Global Split Ratio Management (2026-01-25)
- **Feature**: Create settings screen where users can manage how shared expenses are split between household members
- **Goal**: Allow users to configure split ratios (automatic income-based or manual custom percentages) that apply to all future shared expenses

**Behavior:**
- **Automatic mode**: Calculate split from monthly incomes (e.g., 60/40 based on 5200/3500 CHF incomes)
- **Manual mode**: User sets custom percentages (e.g., 50/50, 70/30)
- **Future-only changes**: Changing split affects ONLY new transactions, existing debt/splits remain unchanged (Option B)
- **Visibility**: Only visible when household has 2+ active members
- **Shared settings**: Both household members see and can edit the same settings

**Database Schema Changes:**
- Added to `households` table:
  - `splitMethod`: `string` (optional) - "automatic" or "manual"
  - `manualSplitRatios`: `json` (optional) - JSON object mapping userId to percentage (e.g., `{ userId1: 60, userId2: 40 }`)

**Implementation:**

1. **Split Settings API** (`src/lib/split-settings-api.ts`):
   - `getSplitSettings(householdId)`: Get current split settings for household
     - Returns `null` if household has < 2 members
     - Returns split method and calculated/manual percentages for each member
   - `updateSplitSettings(householdId, splitMethod, manualRatios?)`: Update split settings
     - Validates manual ratios total 100%
     - Saves to households table
   - `getCurrentSplitRatio(householdId)`: Get split ratio for creating new shared expenses
     - Used by `createExpenseSplits` to apply correct percentages

2. **Shared Expenses API Update** (`src/lib/shared-expenses-api.ts`):
   - Modified `calculateSplitRatio()` to use split settings instead of always calculating from income
   - Now uses `getCurrentSplitRatio()` from split-settings-api
   - Maintains backward compatibility with income field for existing code

3. **Split Settings Screen** (`src/app/settings/split-settings.tsx`):
   - Full-screen settings interface with automatic/manual mode toggle
   - **Current Split Display**: Shows current percentages for each member
   - **Automatic Mode**: Shows income-based split with "Calculated from monthly income ratio" label
   - **Manual Mode Editor**:
     - First person's percentage is editable
     - Second person's percentage auto-calculates (100 - first)
     - Validation: Total must equal 100%
     - Cannot save if validation fails
   - **Toggle Button**: Switch between Automatic and Manual modes
   - **Save Button**: Applies settings to future shared expenses
   - **Info Section**: Explains how automatic/manual modes work

4. **Profile Tab Menu Item** (`src/app/(tabs)/two.tsx`):
   - Added "Expense Splitting" menu item (Users icon)
   - Only visible when household has 2+ active members
   - Positioned after "Payday & Budget Period"
   - Shows description: "Manage how shared expenses are divided"

**User Flows:**

**Test 1 - View Current Split (Automatic):**
1. Alexander opens Profile → Expense Splitting
2. Sees: Alexander 60%, Cecilia 40%
3. Shows "Automatic" mode label
4. Shows "Calculated from monthly income ratio"

**Test 2 - Switch to Manual 50/50:**
1. Tap "Switch to Manual"
2. Mode changes to "Manual"
3. See inputs: Alexander 60%, Cecilia 40%
4. Change Alexander to: 50%
5. Cecilia auto-updates to: 50%
6. Total shows: 100% ✓
7. Tap "Save"
8. Success message shown
9. Future shared expenses use 50/50

**Test 3 - Manual Custom Split:**
1. In manual mode
2. Set Alexander: 70%
3. Cecilia auto-calculates: 30%
4. Save
5. New shared expenses use 70/30

**Test 4 - Back to Automatic:**
1. In manual mode (50/50 set)
2. Tap "Switch to Automatic"
3. Shows income-based: 60/40
4. Save
5. Future expenses use 60/40 (income-based)

**Test 5 - Existing Debt Unchanged:**
1. Current debt: 150 CHF (from old 60/40 splits)
2. Change split to 50/50
3. Debt still shows: 150 CHF ✓
4. Add new 100 CHF shared expense
5. New expense uses 50/50 split
6. Debt increases by 50 CHF (not 40 CHF)

**Test 6 - Solo User:**
1. User with no household members
2. Profile menu does NOT show "Expense Splitting" ✓

**Test 7 - Member Can See/Edit:**
1. Cecilia opens Expense Splitting
2. Can see current split
3. Can change to manual
4. Can save changes
5. Both users see updated split

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- No incomes set (automatic): Defaults to 50/50 even split
- Invalid manual percentages: Cannot save, shows error
- Switching modes doesn't lose data: Settings preserved
- Settings shared across household: Both members see same values
- Only affects future transactions: Existing debt unchanged

**Benefits:**
- **Flexibility**: Choose automatic (fair based on income) or manual (custom arrangement)
- **Simplicity**: Easy percentage editor with auto-calculation
- **Transparency**: Both members see and agree on split settings
- **Stability**: Existing debt unchanged, no retroactive recalculations
- **Smart defaults**: Automatic mode uses income ratios for fair splitting
- **Real-time updates**: Split percentages automatically update when budget income changes

**Implementation Notes:**
- Automatic mode reads from `budgetSummary.totalIncome` (most recent for each user)
- This ensures split percentages always reflect current budget settings
- When users update their monthly income in budget setup, split percentages update automatically
- User names are fetched from `users` table for proper display

**Files Created:**
- `src/lib/split-settings-api.ts` - Split settings management API
- `src/app/settings/split-settings.tsx` - Split settings screen

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/db.ts` - Added splitMethod and manualSplitRatios to households schema
- `src/lib/shared-expenses-api.ts` - Updated calculateSplitRatio to use split settings
- `src/app/(tabs)/two.tsx` - Added Expense Splitting menu item (conditional on 2+ members)

### FIX: Restored Debt Balance Widget to Dashboard (2026-01-25)
- **Issue**: Debt settlement widget disappeared from dashboard for all members
- **Fix**: Added `<DebtBalanceWidget />` back to the dashboard, positioned above True Balance Widget
- **Improvement**: Widget now always shows for 2+ member households, even when balance is 0
- **Location**: Dashboard (Home tab) - appears between Welcome Header and True Balance (Assets) section
- **Visibility**:
  - Shows for all households with 2+ members
  - Displays "All settled up!" when balance is 0.00 CHF
  - Shows debt amount and settlement button when balance > 0
- **States**:
  - **Settled (0 CHF)**: Green card showing "All settled up! ✓" with 0.00 CHF balance
  - **Debt exists**: White card showing amount owed with "Settle Debt" button for the payer
  - **Owed to you**: White card showing amount owed to you (no button)
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Added DebtBalanceWidget component above TrueBalanceWidget
  - `src/components/DebtBalanceWidget.tsx` - Always show widget for 2+ member households, display "settled" state when balance is 0

### FIX: Members Now Only See Their Own Transactions (2026-01-25)
- **Issue**: Members were seeing transactions from other household members (including admin), even when those transactions were personal
- **Expected Behavior**: Members should only see their own transactions in the Transactions tab
- **Fix**: Updated transaction filtering logic to only show transactions created by the current user
- **Impact**:
  - Members now see ONLY their own transactions (both personal and shared)
  - Members do NOT see other members' transactions, even if marked as shared
  - Each member has a private view of their own spending
  - Shared expenses are still tracked in the debt settlement system
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/lib/transactions-api.ts` - Updated `getHouseholdTransactionsWithCreators` filter to show only user's own transactions

### FIX: Removed periodStart/periodEnd from Budget Schema - Made Budgets "Timeless" (2026-01-27)

**Critical Bug Fixed**: Budget queries were failing after payday changes, causing budget spent amounts to show as 0 CHF even when expenses existed.

#### Root Cause
The `budgets` and `budgetSummary` tables stored `periodStart` and `periodEnd` fields. When users changed their payday:
1. Budget period was recalculated dynamically (e.g., from "2025-12-25 to 2026-01-24" → "2026-01-06 to 2026-02-05")
2. Existing budgets still had OLD period dates stored (e.g., `periodStart: "2025-12-25"`)
3. Budget queries filtered by NEW period dates (e.g., `periodStart: "2026-01-06"`)
4. No budgets matched → spent amounts showed as 0 CHF

#### Solution: "Timeless" Budgets
Removed `periodStart` and `periodEnd` from the database schema entirely. Budgets now define WHAT to track (allocations per category), not WHEN. Period filtering happens only when querying transactions:

**Before (BROKEN)**:
```typescript
// Budgets table had: periodStart, periodEnd
// Query looked for: budgets WHERE userId AND periodStart="2026-01-06"
// This failed when stored periodStart was "2025-12-25"
```

**After (FIXED)**:
```typescript
// Budgets table: userId, categoryId, allocatedAmount, spentAmount, isActive
// Query uses: budgets WHERE userId AND categoryId AND isActive=true
// Period filtering ONLY on transactions, not budgets
```

#### Schema Changes

**`budgets` table** - Removed:
- `periodStart` (removed)
- `periodEnd` (removed)

**`budgetSummary` table** - Removed:
- `periodStart` (removed)
- `periodEnd` (removed)
- Added: `isActive` (boolean, optional)

#### Code Changes

**Files Modified:**
1. **`src/lib/db.ts`**
   - Removed `periodStart` and `periodEnd` from `budgets` entity
   - Removed `periodStart` and `periodEnd` from `budgetSummary` entity
   - Added `isActive` field to `budgetSummary` entity

2. **`src/lib/budget-api.ts`**
   - `saveBudget()`: Changed budget deletion query from `periodStart` filter to `isActive: true`
   - `saveBudget()`: Removed `periodStart`/`periodEnd` from budget creation
   - `resetBudgetForNewPeriod()`: Changed query to filter by `isActive: true` instead of `periodEnd`
   - `resetMemberBudgetIfNeeded()`: Changed query to filter by `isActive: true` instead of `periodEnd`

3. **`src/lib/transactions-api.ts`**
   - `createTransaction()`: Changed budget query from `periodStart` filter to `isActive: true`
   - `deleteTransaction()`: Changed budget query from `periodStart` filter to `isActive: true`
   - `updateTransaction()`: Changed all budget queries (old category, new category, amount change) from `periodStart` filter to `isActive: true`

4. **`src/lib/settlement-api.ts`**
   - `createSettlement()`: Changed budget query from `periodStart` filter to `isActive: true`

#### How It Works Now

1. **Budget Creation**: User sets allocations per category → budgets created with `isActive: true` (no period dates)
2. **Transaction Created**: System queries `budgets WHERE userId AND categoryId AND isActive: true` → updates `spentAmount`
3. **Spent Calculation**: Filters transactions by date range (from dynamic period calculation) → sums amounts → updates budget
4. **Payday Change**: Period recalculates dynamically → same budgets still match (because query uses `isActive: true`, not period dates)

#### Benefits

✅ **Payday changes work correctly**: Budgets persist across payday changes without showing 0 CHF
✅ **No stale period dates**: Period always calculated dynamically from `paydayDay` setting
✅ **Simpler architecture**: Period is a query-time concern, not a storage concern
✅ **Auto-reset still works**: When new month starts, period shifts forward automatically
✅ **Budget updates work**: Transactions update budget spent amounts correctly regardless of payday setting

#### Testing

After this fix:
- ✅ Changing payday from 27 → 28 → 6 no longer causes budget to show 0 CHF
- ✅ Transactions dated within current period correctly update budget spent amounts
- ✅ Budget period dates display correctly (from dynamic calculation)
- ✅ All budget queries work without period date filters

## Recent Changes

### Fix: Future Transactions Not Counted in Balance/Budget Until Date (2026-02-01)

**Problem**: When users added recurring transactions or transactions with future dates, they were immediately counted in:
1. Account balance calculations
2. Budget spent amounts

This was incorrect - future transactions should only affect balances and budgets when their date arrives.

**The Fix** (`src/lib/transactions-api.ts`):

**1. Create Transaction:**
- Added check for future transaction: `const isFutureTransaction = request.date > todayStr`
- Account balance is now only updated if `!isFutureTransaction`
- Budget spent amount is now only updated if `!isFutureTransaction`

**2. Delete Transaction:**
- Added same future transaction check
- Balance is now only restored if the transaction was not a future transaction (since it wasn't deducted in the first place)
- Budget spent amount is only updated if not a future transaction

**Note**: The budget recalculation function (`recalculateBudgetSpentAmounts`) already correctly excluded future transactions with `tx.date <= todayStr`.

**Result**:
- ✅ Future-dated transactions don't affect current account balance
- ✅ Future-dated transactions don't affect budget spent amounts
- ✅ Recurring templates work correctly without affecting totals
- ✅ When the date arrives, users can manually process or the app recalculates

### UI/UX Improvements: Shared Expense Toggle Visibility (2026-01-28)

**Problem**: User reported two issues with shared expense feature:
1. Share toggle in Add Transaction screen was too bright/hard to see
2. Edit Transaction screen was missing the share toggle entirely

**The Fix**:

**1. Add Transaction Screen (`src/app/transactions/add.tsx`):**
- Improved shared expense toggle visibility:
  - Changed from border-top design to rounded card with background
  - Added `rounded-xl border-2 border-gray-200 bg-gray-50` styling
  - Updated Switch colors:
    - Inactive (off): `#E5E7EB` (lighter gray, more visible)
    - Active (on): `#059669` (emerald green)
  - Added `ios_backgroundColor="#E5E7EB"` for iOS consistency
  - Result: Toggle now has clear visual separation and better contrast

**2. Edit Transaction Screen (`src/app/transactions/[id]/edit.tsx`):**
- **Added complete shared expense functionality** (was missing):
  - Imported `Switch` and `createExpenseSplits` / `calculateSplitRatio` from shared-expenses-api
  - Added shared expense state: `isShared` and `paidByUserId`
  - Added queries:
    - `householdMembersQuery`: Load all active household members
    - `splitRatiosQuery`: Calculate split percentages
  - Updated FormData interface to include `isShared?` and `paidByUserId?`
  - Pre-fill shared state from transaction data when editing
  - Auto-select current user as payer when members load
  - Updated mutation to save shared expense data and create splits
  - Added UI controls (matching add screen):
    - Shared expense toggle (only for expense type, 2+ members)
    - Split preview box showing percentages
    - "Who paid?" selector with member cards
  - Positioning: Added after recurring controls, before "Exclude from Budget"

**Visual Improvements**:
- Both screens now use consistent card design for shared expense toggle
- Better contrast and visibility with lighter gray background
- Clearer distinction between on/off states
- Professional rounded styling matching app aesthetic

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/transactions/add.tsx`: Enhanced toggle visibility
- `src/app/transactions/[id]/edit.tsx`: Added full shared expense support
- `README.md`: Documented changes

**Result**:
- ✅ Share toggle now clearly visible in Add Transaction screen
- ✅ Edit Transaction screen now supports editing shared expense properties
- ✅ Users can convert personal expenses to shared (or vice versa) when editing
- ✅ Consistent UX between add and edit flows

### ENHANCEMENT: Settlement Wallet Selection (2026-01-28)

**Feature**: Added wallet selection dropdowns to the Settlement Screen so users can specify which wallets are involved in the settlement transaction.

**Problem**: Previously, the settlement screen automatically selected the first available wallet for both payer and receiver. Users needed the ability to choose specific wallets for the settlement.

**Implementation**:

**1. Settlement Screen (`src/app/settlement.tsx`):**
- Added new state variables:
  - `yourWalletId` - Selected wallet for current user
  - `partnerWalletId` - Selected wallet for partner
  - `showYourWalletPicker` - Modal visibility for your wallet picker
  - `showPartnerWalletPicker` - Modal visibility for partner's wallet picker

- Added new queries:
  - `partnerAccountsData` - Fetches partner's wallets from database
  - Default wallet auto-selection when data loads

- Added wallet selection UI:
  - **Your Wallet dropdown**: Shows current user's wallets with name, balance
  - **Partner's Wallet dropdown**: Shows partner's wallets with name, balance
  - Labels change based on debt direction:
    - If you owe: "Pay From (Your Wallet)" / "Send To (Partner's Wallet)"
    - If you're owed: "Receive In (Your Wallet)" / "From (Partner's Wallet)"

- Added wallet picker modals:
  - Page sheet presentation with close button
  - List of wallets showing: name, institution, balance
  - Selected wallet highlighted with checkmark
  - Teal color for your wallet, blue for partner's wallet

- Updated settlement mutation:
  - Uses selected wallet IDs instead of auto-selecting first wallet
  - Correctly determines payer/receiver based on debt direction
  - Validates both wallets are selected before allowing settlement

- Updated settle button:
  - Text changes based on debt direction: "Pay X CHF" vs "Confirm Received X CHF"
  - Disabled until both wallets are selected

**UI Design**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Settlement Details                  │
│                                     │

│ ─────────────────────────────────  │
│ Settlement Amount: 105.36 CHF      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/settlement.tsx`: Added wallet selection dropdowns and picker modals

**Result**:
- ✅ Users can select which wallet to pay from or receive into
- ✅ Partner's wallets are visible and selectable
- ✅ Clear labels indicate payment direction (pay vs receive)
- ✅ Default wallet auto-selected but changeable
- ✅ Both wallets must be selected to enable settlement button

### ENHANCEMENT: Improved Share Toggle Visibility (2026-01-28)

**Problem**: The share expense toggle was hard to see - too subtle styling.

**The Fix**:

**Both Add and Edit Transaction Screens:**
- Enhanced toggle container with dynamic styling based on state:
  - OFF state: White background, gray border (`border-gray-300 bg-white`)
  - ON state: Teal background, teal border (`border-teal-600 bg-teal-50`)
- Updated text colors to match state:
  - OFF: Gray text (`text-gray-900`, `text-gray-600`)
  - ON: Teal text (`text-teal-700`, `text-teal-600`)
- Improved Switch component colors:
  - Track OFF: `#9CA3AF` (more visible gray)
  - Track ON: `#0D9488` (teal)
  - Thumb changes based on state for better visual feedback

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/transactions/add.tsx`: Improved toggle styling
- `src/app/transactions/[id]/edit.tsx`: Improved toggle styling (matching)

**Result**:
- ✅ Toggle now has clear visual distinction between on/off states
- ✅ Entire container changes appearance when toggled
- ✅ Much better visibility and contrast
- ✅ Consistent styling across add and edit screens

### PRIVACY FIX: Settlement Screen Privacy Protection (2026-01-28)

**Problem**: Settlement screen exposed private financial data:
1. **Category Privacy Leak**: Displayed other member's personal category names
2. **Wallet Privacy Leak**: Displayed other member's wallet names and balances

**The Fix**:

**1. Category Privacy Protection:**
- Added `getCategoryDisplay()` helper function with privacy rules:
  - Shows category name if it's a common category (Groceries, Rent, Utilities, etc.)
  - Shows category name if current user created the transaction
  - Otherwise shows "Shared Expense" (protects partner's personal categories)
- Updated `UnsettledExpense` interface to include `createdByUserId`
- Description only shown for transactions created by current user

**2. Wallet Privacy Protection:**
- Removed partner wallet selection dropdown entirely
- Users only see and select their own wallets
- Settlement automatically uses partner's default wallet
- Added privacy-friendly helper text: "{Partner} will receive this in their default wallet"
- Partner's wallet names and balances completely hidden

**UI Changes**:
```
Before (PRIVACY LEAK):
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ☑ Shopping                          │ ← Partner's personal category!
│ ☑ Work Lunch                        │ ← User's personal category!
│                                     │
│ Partner's Wallet:                   │
│ [Their Savings (5,000 CHF) ▼]      │ ← Their wallet exposed!
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

After (PRIVATE):
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ☑ Shared Expense                    │ ← Partner's category hidden
│ ☑ Work Lunch                        │ ← Your category visible
│                                     │
│ Your Wallet:                        │
│ [UBS Checking (2,500 CHF) ▼]       │ ← Only YOUR wallets
│ ℹ️ Partner receives in default     │ ← Privacy info
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/settlement-api.ts`: Added `createdByUserId` to `UnsettledExpense` interface
- `src/app/settlement.tsx`:
  - Added category privacy filter with common categories list
  - Removed partner wallet selection state and queries
  - Removed partner wallet picker modal
  - Updated mutation to fetch partner's default wallet automatically
  - Added privacy-friendly helper text

**Result**:
- ✅ Partner's personal category names completely hidden
- ✅ Common categories (Groceries, Rent, etc.) still visible to both
- ✅ Partner's wallet information completely hidden
- ✅ Settlement still works - uses partner's default wallet automatically
- ✅ Users only see their own financial data
- ✅ Descriptions only shown for user's own transactions

### FEATURE: Settlement Category and Payee Selection (2026-01-28)
**Feature**: Added payee field and category selection to settlement form for proper transaction categorization.

**Requirements**:
- Payee should be set to the partner receiving/sending money (read-only)
- Category selection from user's expense categories
- Category group auto-selected based on chosen category (same behavior as transactions)

**Implementation**:

**1. Payee Field:**
- Added read-only payee field showing partner's name
- Label changes based on debt direction:
  - If you owe: "Payee (Who Receives)"
  - If you're owed: "Payer (Who Sends)"
- Displays partner's name with descriptive text

**2. Category Selection:**
- Added category dropdown showing all user's expense categories
- **CONDITIONAL DISPLAY**: Category selection only shown when user OWES money (youOwe === true)
- When receiving money, no category selection needed (they're receiving, not making an expense)
- Category picker modal with full category list
- Shows category name and category group for each option
- Selected category highlighted with checkmark
- Required field (when shown) - settlement button disabled until category selected

**3. Auto Category Group:**
- Category group automatically determined from selected category
- Displayed under category name in the dropdown
- No separate category group selector needed (same as transactions)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/settlement.tsx`:
  - Added `selectedCategoryId` state
  - Added `showCategoryPicker` state
  - Added query to load user's expense categories
  - Added payee display field (read-only)
  - Added category selection dropdown
  - Added category picker modal
  - Updated settlement mutation to pass category ID
  - Button disabled until category selected

**Result**:
- ✅ Payee displayed showing who receives/sends money
- ✅ Category selection ONLY shown when user owes money (making payment)
- ✅ Category selection hidden when user is receiving money (no expense to categorize)
- ✅ Category selection from user's expense categories
- ✅ Category group automatically shown with category
- ✅ Settlement transaction properly categorized in budget
- ✅ Matches transaction form behavior
- ✅ All required fields enforced before settlement can be completed
\n### BUG FIX: Settlement Disappearing Expenses (2026-01-28)\n**Issue**: When settling 2 out of 3 expenses, only 1 settlement transaction appeared and the last expense to settle disappeared.\n\n**Root Cause**:\nThe settlement logic was incorrectly marking the ENTIRE transaction as `settled: true` even when only SOME splits were paid. This caused the `getUnsettledSharedExpenses` function to filter out the transaction completely, making remaining unsettled expenses disappear.\n\nExample:\n- Transaction A has 3 splits (3 shared expenses)\n- User settles 2 splits\n- System marked Transaction A as `settled: true`\n- System filters out Transaction A from unsettled expenses\n- Third split becomes invisible even though it's still unpaid\n\n**Fix**:\nModified `createSettlement` function in `src/lib/settlement-api.ts`:\n1. **Only mark splits as paid**: Changed to mark individual splits as `isPaid: true` (correct behavior)\n2. **Check all splits before marking transaction as settled**: Added logic to check if ALL splits for a transaction are paid before marking the transaction as `settled: true`\n3. **Conditional transaction settlement**: Transaction only marked as settled when every single split is paid\n\n**Files Modified**:\n- `src/lib/settlement-api.ts` (lines 537-587):\n  - Separated amount reduction from settlement marking\n  - Added loop to check all splits for each transaction\n  - Only set `settled: true` when all splits are `isPaid: true`\n  - Keeps transaction as unsettled if any splits remain unpaid\n\n**Result**:\n- ✅ Settling 2 out of 3 expenses works correctly\n- ✅ Third expense remains visible in settlement screen\n- ✅ Transaction amounts properly reduced for each settlement\n- ✅ Transactions only marked as settled when fully paid\n- ✅ All settlement transactions appear in transaction list

### CRITICAL BUG FIX: Settlement Settling Wrong Splits (2026-01-28)
**Issue**: When settling 1 out of 3 expenses, ALL splits were being marked as paid instead of just the selected one. This caused all remaining expenses to disappear.

**Root Cause**:
The `createSettlement` function was NOT receiving information about which specific splits were selected. It was settling ALL unpaid splits between the payer and receiver, regardless of user selection.

Example:
- User has 3 unsettled expenses (3 splits)
- User selects only 1 expense to settle
- Frontend: `selectedExpenses = [split1.id]`
- Backend: Receives no split IDs, settles ALL 3 splits
- Result: All 3 splits marked as paid, remaining 2 disappear

**Fix**:
1. **Added `selectedSplitIds` parameter** to `createSettlement` function in `src/lib/settlement-api.ts`
2. **Filter splits by selection**: Only settle splits that are in the `selectedSplitIds` array
3. **Pass selection from frontend**: Settlement screen now passes `selectedExpenses` array to backend

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/settlement-api.ts`:
  - Added `selectedSplitIds?: string[]` parameter to `createSettlement` function (line 311)
  - Added filtering logic to only settle selected splits (lines 492-498)
  - Added detailed logging for debugging selection
  
- `src/app/settlement.tsx`:
  - Pass `selectedExpenses` array to `createSettlement` call (line 214)

**Result**:
- ✅ Settling 1 out of 3 expenses only marks that 1 split as paid
- ✅ Remaining 2 expenses stay visible and unpaid
- ✅ User can settle expenses one at a time or multiple at once
- ✅ Selection is properly respected by backend
- ✅ No more disappearing expenses

**Testing**:
1. Create 3 shared expenses
2. Go to settlement screen - all 3 should show
3. Deselect 2 expenses, select only 1
4. Complete settlement
5. Go back to settlement screen - remaining 2 should still be visible

### FEATURE: Settlement Shows Original Transaction Payee (2026-01-28)
**Feature**: Settlement screen now displays the payee from the original shared expense transaction, and this payee is saved in the settlement transaction for proper record-keeping.

**Why This Matters**:
When settling a debt, users need to know WHO the original payment was made to (the payee) so they can:
1. Choose the appropriate category for their settlement payment
2. See the context of what they're paying for
3. Have complete transaction records showing the original payee

**Implementation**:

**1. Added Payee to UnsettledExpense Interface:**
- Added `payee: string` field to track the original transaction's payee
- Populated from `transaction.payee` when loading unsettled expenses
- Available for all unsettled shared expenses

**2. Settlement Screen Display:**
- Added "Original Payee (For Your Records)" field (read-only)
- Shows the payee from the first selected expense
- Only displayed when you OWE money (making a payment)
- Helps users understand what they're paying for
- Located above the category selection for context

**3. Settlement Transaction Creation:**
- Original payee is passed to the settlement API
- Settlement transaction includes the payee in its record
- Users can see the payee in their transaction list after settling
- Maintains complete transaction history with proper payee information

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/settlement-api.ts`:
  - Added `payee: string` field to `UnsettledExpense` interface (line 21)
  - Populate payee when creating unsettled expenses (line 147)
  - Added `payee?: string` parameter to `createSettlement` function (line 296)
  - Include payee in settlement transaction creation (line 411)

- `src/app/settlement.tsx`:
  - Calculate `originalPayee` from first selected expense (line 312)
  - Display "Original Payee" field in settlement details (lines 439-453)
  - Pass payee to `createSettlement` API call (line 216)

**Result**:
- ✅ Settlement screen shows original transaction payee (read-only)
- ✅ Payee helps users choose appropriate category
- ✅ Settlement transaction includes payee in records
- ✅ Complete transaction history maintained
- ✅ Users can see what they paid for in their transaction list

**Example Flow**:
1. Ceci shares expense: "Whole Foods" (payee: Whole Foods)
2. Alexander owes his share: 50 CHF
3. Alexander goes to settlement screen
4. Settlement shows: "Original Payee: Whole Foods"
5. Alexander selects category: "Groceries"
6. After settlement, his transaction list shows: "Whole Foods - 50 CHF - Groceries"

### FEATURE: Recurring Expenses - Template System (2026-01-28)
**Feature**: Fixed recurring expenses to create templates instead of immediate transactions. Recurring expenses now appear on the dashboard when due and can be added manually.

**Problem**:
Previously, when users set up a recurring expense (e.g., "Rent - 1,500 CHF on the 1st"), the system immediately created a transaction in the transaction list, affecting the current budget. This was incorrect behavior.

**Solution**:
Implemented a template-based system where recurring expenses create templates that:
1. Do NOT appear in transaction list immediately
2. Do NOT affect budget until manually added
3. Show reminders on dashboard when due
4. Can be added each month with one tap

**Implementation**:

**1. New Database Schema:**
- Added `recurringTemplates` entity to store recurring expense templates
- Added `createdFromTemplateId` field to transactions to track template origin
- Templates store: amount, category, wallet, recurring day (1-31), payee, note

**2. Recurring API (`src/lib/recurring-api.ts`):**
- `createRecurringTemplate()` - Creates template (not transaction)
- `getActiveRecurringTemplates()` - Gets active templates for user
- `shouldCreateThisMonth()` - Checks if template is due this month
- `createTransactionFromTemplate()` - Creates actual transaction from template
- Handles edge cases like Feb 31 → Feb 28

**3. Add Transaction Screen Updates (`src/app/transactions/add.tsx`):**
- Modified mutation to detect recurring expenses
- If recurring: creates template only (no transaction)
- If regular: creates normal transaction
- Recurring expenses cannot be shared (disabled automatically)
- Shows helpful message: "This will create a recurring template"
- Alert after creation: "Your recurring expense will appear on day X of each month"

**4. Dashboard Widget (`src/components/RecurringExpensesWidget.tsx`):**
- Shows amber-colored widget with due recurring expenses
- Only appears when recurring expenses are due (recurring day has passed)
- Displays: payee/category, amount, due date
- "Add" button creates transaction for current month
- Automatically hides templates after adding
- Widget disappears if no recurring expenses are due

**5. Dashboard Integration (`src/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`):**
- Added RecurringExpensesWidget after Welcome Header
- Appears prominently at top of dashboard
- Only shows when there are due recurring expenses

**Files Created**:
- `src/lib/recurring-api.ts` - Complete recurring template management
- `src/components/RecurringExpensesWidget.tsx` - Dashboard reminder widget

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/db.ts`:
  - Added `recurringTemplates` entity
  - Added `createdFromTemplateId` field to transactions
- `src/app/transactions/add.tsx`:
  - Import recurring API
  - Modified createMutation to handle templates
  - Added template vs transaction detection
  - Disabled shared expenses for recurring
  - Added helpful UI messages
- `src/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`:
  - Import RecurringExpensesWidget
  - Added widget to dashboard

**User Flow**:

**Creating Recurring Expense:**
1. User goes to Add Transaction
2. Enters amount: 1,500 CHF
3. Selects category: Rent
4. Selects wallet: UBS Checking
5. Checks "This repeats monthly"
6. Sets day: 1st of month
7. Saves

Result:
- ✅ Template created (not transaction)
- ✅ Does NOT appear in transaction list
- ✅ Does NOT affect current budget
- ✅ Alert: "Your recurring expense will appear on day 1 of each month"

**Adding Recurring Expense (Each Month):**
1. User opens dashboard on/after the 1st
2. Sees amber widget: "Recurring Expenses - Ready to add this month"
3. Shows: "Rent - 1,500 CHF • Due: Feb 1"
4. Taps "Add" button
5. Transaction created with date = Feb 1

Result:
- ✅ Transaction appears in transaction list
- ✅ Counts toward Feb budget
- ✅ Widget hides this template until next month
- ✅ Template ready for next month (March)

**Edge Cases Handled**:
1. **Month with fewer days**: Recurring day 31 in February → Creates transaction on Feb 28/29
2. **Already added**: If template added this month, widget doesn't show it again
3. **Multiple templates**: Widget shows all due templates, can add each individually
4. **Future dates**: If recurring day hasn't arrived yet (e.g., today is 5th, recurring day is 15th), widget doesn't show it

**Result**:
- ✅ Recurring expenses work correctly (template-based)
- ✅ No immediate transactions created
- ✅ Dashboard shows reminders when due
- ✅ One-tap add each month
- ✅ Budget accuracy maintained
- ✅ Clean separation: templates vs transactions
- ✅ Recurring expenses cannot be shared
- ✅ User-friendly alerts and messages

### BUG FIX: Settlement Screen UX and Duplicate Splits (2026-01-30)

**Issue 1: Misleading "Your share" Text**
When viewing the settlement screen as an admin/receiver (someone who is owed money), the label "Your share" was confusing. It showed the amount the other member owes you, but "Your share" implied it was your portion of an expense, not the amount you're receiving.

**Issue 2: Duplicate Splits on Transaction Update**
When updating a shared transaction (e.g., changing amount or category), the system created NEW splits instead of updating the existing ones. This resulted in duplicate split records in the database that had to be manually deleted.

**Root Cause**:
1. **Issue 1**: The settlement screen used "Your share: X CHF" for both scenarios (when you owe and when you're owed), making it unclear for receivers
2. **Issue 2**: The edit transaction mutation called `createExpenseSplits()` without first deleting existing splits, causing duplicates to accumulate

**Fix**:

**1. Settlement Screen Text (src/app/settlement.tsx:395-410)**:
Changed from:
```tsx
Your share: {Math.abs(expense.yourShare).toFixed(2)} CHF
```

To:
```tsx
{expenseYouOwe ? 'You owe' : 'You are owed'}: {Math.abs(expense.yourShare).toFixed(2)} CHF
```

**2. Transaction Update Split Handling (src/app/transactions/[id]/edit.tsx:239-257)**:
Changed from:
```tsx
if (isShared && id) {
  await createExpenseSplits(...);
}
```

To:
```tsx
if (id) {
  if (isShared) {
    // Delete existing splits first (to avoid duplicates)
    const { deleteExpenseSplits } = await import('@/lib/shared-expenses-api');
    await deleteExpenseSplits(id);

    // Then create new splits with updated values
    await createExpenseSplits(...);
  } else if (originalTransaction?.isShared && !isShared) {
    // If changed from shared to not shared, delete all splits
    const { deleteExpenseSplits } = await import('@/lib/shared-expenses-api');
    await deleteExpenseSplits(id);
  }
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/settlement.tsx` (line 407):
  - Changed "Your share" to conditional text
  - Shows "You owe" when amount is positive (red color)
  - Shows "You are owed" when amount is negative (green color)

- `src/app/transactions/[id]/edit.tsx` (lines 239-257):
  - Added `deleteExpenseSplits()` call before creating new splits
  - Handles three scenarios:
    1. Transaction is shared → Delete old splits, create new ones
    2. Transaction changed from shared to not shared → Delete all splits
    3. Transaction is not shared → No split operations
  - Prevents duplicate split records in database

**Result**:
- ✅ Settlement screen clearly shows "You owe" vs "You are owed"
- ✅ Amount color matches the label (red for owe, green for owed)
- ✅ Updating shared transactions no longer creates duplicate splits
- ✅ Changing shared status properly adds/removes splits
- ✅ Database remains clean without manual intervention
- ✅ No more orphaned split records

### FEATURE: Upcoming Recurring Section in Transaction List (2026-01-30)

**Feature**: Added a collapsible section at the top of the transaction list showing upcoming recurring expenses with ability to add them immediately.

**Problem**:
Users had to go to the dashboard to see upcoming recurring expenses. There was no way to view or add them directly from the transaction list screen where they manage all their transactions.

**Solution**:
Implemented a collapsible "Upcoming Recurring" section that appears at the top of the transaction list, showing all due recurring expenses with one-tap "Add Now" functionality.

**Implementation**:

**1. New Component (`src/components/UpcomingRecurringSection.tsx`):**
- Collapsible section with chevron icon (right/down) and count badge
- Shows all recurring templates that are due (using `shouldCreateThisMonth()`)
- Each template displays:
  - Recurring icon (🔄) and category name
  - Amount and due date
  - Overdue indicator (⚠️) if past due date
  - Payee (if set)
  - "Add Now" button to create transaction
- Collapsed state persisted in AsyncStorage (key: `recurringSection_collapsed`)
- Default state: Collapsed (to avoid cluttering the list)
- Auto-hides when no recurring templates are due

**2. Transaction List Integration (`src/app/(tabs)/transactions.tsx`):**
- Added import for `UpcomingRecurringSection`
- Placed component between filter bar and transaction list
- Passes `userId` and `householdId` as props
- Component conditionally renders only when user data is available

**3. Visual Design:**
- Light blue background (`#EFF6FF`) to distinguish from transactions
- Blue border (`border-blue-200`) for visual separation
- Header with collapsible chevron and "Tap to view" hint
- Individual template cards with white background
- Blue accent colors throughout for consistency
- Overdue indicator in orange for attention

**4. State Management:**
- Uses React Query for template data fetching
- Queries `recurring-templates` with userId and householdId
- Filters templates using `shouldCreateThisMonth()` logic
- Sorts by next occurrence date (earliest first)
- Enriches templates with category names
- Mutation for creating transactions invalidates all relevant queries

**5. User Interaction:**
- Tap header to toggle expand/collapse
- Tap "Add Now" to create transaction from template
- Shows loading indicator while creating
- Auto-refreshes list after adding
- State persists across app sessions

**Files Created**:
- `src/components/UpcomingRecurringSection.tsx` - Collapsible recurring section component

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/(tabs)/transactions.tsx`:
  - Added import for `UpcomingRecurringSection`
  - Integrated component above transaction list (after filters)
  - Conditional rendering based on user data availability

**User Flow**:

**Viewing Upcoming Recurring Expenses:**
1. User navigates to Transactions tab
2. Sees collapsed section at top: "▶ Upcoming Recurring (3)"
3. Taps header to expand
4. Views all due recurring expenses with details

**Adding a Recurring Expense:**
1. User sees "Rent - 1,500 CHF • Due: Feb 1"
2. Taps "Add Now" button
3. Transaction created for current/due date
4. Button shows loading indicator
5. List refreshes automatically
6. Template removed from upcoming list (added this month)
7. Transaction appears in main list below

**State Persistence:**
1. User expands section to view templates
2. Navigates away from Transactions tab
3. Returns to Transactions tab
4. Section remains expanded (state persisted)

**Visual Behavior**:

**Collapsed State:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ ▶ Upcoming Recurring (3)        │
│   Tap to view                   │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Expanded State:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ ▼ Upcoming Recurring (3)        │
│ ┌───────────────────────────┐   │
│ │ 🔄 Rent                   │   │
│ │ 1,500 CHF • Due: Feb 1   │   │
│ │               [Add Now]   │   │
│ └───────────────────────────┘   │
│ ┌───────────────────────────┐   │
│ │ 🔄 Gym - 80 CHF          │   │
│ │ Due: Feb 5 • ⚠️ Overdue   │   │
│ │               [Add Now]   │   │
│ └───────────────────────────┘   │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Edge Cases Handled**:
1. **No recurring templates**: Section doesn't render at all
2. **Already added this month**: Templates filtered out using `shouldCreateThisMonth()`
3. **Future dates**: Only shows templates where recurring day has arrived
4. **Overdue templates**: Shows orange warning indicator
5. **Loading state**: Shows spinner in "Add Now" button while creating
6. **State persistence**: Collapsed/expanded state saved in AsyncStorage
7. **Multi-platform**: Works on iOS, Android, and Web

**Result**:
- ✅ Upcoming recurring expenses visible in transaction list
- ✅ Collapsible section saves screen space
- ✅ One-tap "Add Now" for quick transaction creation
- ✅ State persisted across sessions
- ✅ Clear visual distinction from regular transactions
- ✅ Overdue indicator for missed recurring expenses
- ✅ Auto-hides when no templates are due
- ✅ Smooth animations and loading states
- ✅ Consistent with app design system

### FEATURE: Edit Recurring Expenses + Fix "Add Now" Date (2026-01-31)

**Issue**: Two critical problems with recurring expenses:
1. **No way to edit recurring templates** - Once created, users couldn't modify amount, category, day, etc.
2. **"Add Now" used wrong date** - Clicking "Add Now" on Jan 30 created transaction with due date (Feb 1) instead of today's date (Jan 30)

**Solution**: Added full edit functionality and fixed date logic.

**1. Fixed "Add Now" Date Logic (`src/lib/recurring-api.ts`):**
- Updated `createTransactionFromTemplate()` to accept optional `customDate` parameter
- When "Add Now" is clicked: Uses today's date
- When auto-created: Uses recurring day
- Added logging to track which date is being used

**2. Added Edit Button to UI:**
- Updated `src/components/RecurringExpensesWidget.tsx`:
  - Added Edit2 icon button next to "Add Now"
  - Imported useRouter from expo-router
  - Added handleEditTemplate() to navigate to edit page
- Updated `src/components/UpcomingRecurringSection.tsx`:
  - Added Edit2 icon button
  - Same edit navigation functionality

**3. Created Edit Page (`src/app/recurring/edit/[id].tsx`):**
- Full edit form with all template fields:
  - Amount (decimal input with CHF)
  - Category (horizontal scroll selector)
  - Account (horizontal scroll selector)
  - Recurring Day (1-31 grid selector)
  - Payee (optional text field)
  - Note (optional multiline text)
- Save Changes button updates template
- Delete button (header right) deactivates template
- Confirmation alerts for both actions
- Loading states during mutations
- Auto-populates form with current template data
- React Query for data fetching and mutations
- Validates amount, category, and account before saving

**4. Updated Mutations:**
- `src/components/RecurringExpensesWidget.tsx`:
  - Changed mutation to accept `{ templateId, date }` object
  - Pass `today` when "Add Now" clicked
- `src/components/UpcomingRecurringSection.tsx`:
  - Same mutation pattern
  - Fixed comparison for loading state

**5. Routing Configuration:**
- Created `src/app/recurring/_layout.tsx` for recurring routes
- Updated `src/app/_layout.tsx`:
  - Added `inRecurringFlow` auth check
  - Registered "recurring" route in Stack
  - Added to protected routes list

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/recurring-api.ts` - Added customDate parameter to createTransactionFromTemplate()
- `src/components/RecurringExpensesWidget.tsx` - Added Edit button and updated mutation
- `src/components/UpcomingRecurringSection.tsx` - Added Edit button and updated mutation
- `src/app/recurring/edit/[id].tsx` - NEW: Full edit page with form
- `src/app/recurring/_layout.tsx` - NEW: Recurring routes layout
- `src/app/_layout.tsx` - Added recurring route registration and auth

**UI Changes:**

Before:
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔄 Rent - 1,500 CHF        │
│    Due: Feb 1    [Add Now]  │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

After:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔄 Rent - 1,500 CHF            │
│    Due: Feb 1  [✏️] [Add Now]  │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Usage Flow:**

**Editing a Recurring Expense:**
1. User sees recurring expense on dashboard or transaction list
2. Taps Edit (✏️) button
3. Edit page opens with pre-filled form
4. Can modify:
   - Amount (e.g., 1,500 → 1,600 CHF)
   - Category (e.g., Rent → Housing)
   - Account (e.g., Checking → Credit Card)
   - Day (e.g., 1st → 5th)
   - Payee (e.g., Landlord → Property Manager)
   - Note (e.g., Monthly rent → Includes parking)
5. Taps "Save Changes"
6. Template updated, success alert shown
7. Returns to previous screen
8. Changes reflected immediately

**Deleting a Recurring Expense:**
1. User taps Edit (✏️) button
2. Taps Trash icon in header
3. Confirmation alert: "Are you sure? Past transactions won't be affected."
4. Taps "Delete"
5. Template deactivated (soft delete)
6. Removed from recurring lists
7. Past transactions remain unchanged

**"Add Now" with Correct Date:**
1. Today: Jan 30
2. Recurring template: Rent - Due Feb 1
3. User taps "Add Now"
4. Transaction created with date = Jan 30 ✓
5. Shows in transaction list as Jan 30 ✓
6. Template's lastCreatedDate updated to Jan 30
7. Won't show again this month

**Edge Cases Handled:**
1. **Amount validation**: Requires positive number
2. **Category required**: Must select category before saving
3. **Account required**: Must select account before saving
4. **Delete confirmation**: Prevents accidental deletion
5. **Past transactions preserved**: Deleting template doesn't affect history
6. **Loading states**: Disabled buttons and spinners during save/delete
7. **Navigation**: Auto-returns to previous screen after success
8. **Date precision**: "Add Now" always uses current date, not recurring day

**Result:**
- ✅ Can edit all recurring template fields
- ✅ Edit button visible on both dashboard and transaction list
- ✅ Full edit page with beautiful form
- ✅ Save and delete functionality
- ✅ "Add Now" uses today's date correctly
- ✅ Past transactions unaffected by edits/deletes
- ✅ Proper validation and error handling
- ✅ Smooth navigation and UX
- ✅ Consistent with app design system

### FEATURE: Future Transactions in Upcoming Section (2026-01-31)

**Issue**: The "Upcoming" section only showed recurring templates, not future-dated transactions. When users created transactions with future dates (e.g., Feb 5), they appeared in the main transaction list alongside past transactions, making it confusing to see what's upcoming.

**Solution**: Updated the "Upcoming" section to show both recurring templates AND future-dated transactions, with clear visual distinction between them.

**1. Updated UpcomingRecurringSection Component:**
- Added query to load future transactions from household
- Filter transactions where date > today
- Sort by date (earliest first)
- Enrich with category and account names
- Calculate total upcoming items (templates + future transactions)
- Split into two sections: "RECURRING" and "SCHEDULED"
- Different icons and styling for each type

**2. Visual Distinction:**

**Recurring Templates:**
- Icon: 🔄 (RefreshCw icon in blue)
- Label: "Due: Feb 1"
- Buttons: [Edit] [Add Now]
- Meaning: Template, not created yet, can add anytime

**Future Transactions:**
- Icon: 📅 (Calendar icon in purple)
- Label: "Feb 5 • In 6 days"
- Button: [Edit] only (no "Add Now")
- Meaning: Already created transaction, scheduled for future
- Shows relative time: "Tomorrow" or "In X days"

**3. Filtered Main Transaction List:**
- Added filter to exclude future transactions (date > today)
- Main list now shows only past and today's transactions
- Future transactions appear in "Upcoming" section until their date arrives

**Result:**
- ✅ "Upcoming" section shows both recurring templates and future transactions
- ✅ Clear visual distinction with different icons (🔄 vs 📅)
- ✅ Recurring templates have "Add Now" button
- ✅ Future transactions have "Edit" button only
- ✅ Main transaction list shows past + today only
- ✅ Future transactions excluded from main list
- ✅ Relative time labels ("Tomorrow", "In X days")
- ✅ Automatic updates when dates arrive
- ✅ Section headers separate recurring from scheduled

### FIX: Future Transactions Excluded from Budget Calculations (2026-01-31)

**Issue**: Future transactions were being included in budget calculations, net worth, and analytics, affecting current financial status incorrectly. For example, a transaction dated Feb 5 would count toward January's budget spent amount.

**Solution**: Updated all calculation functions to exclude future transactions (date > today). Future transactions now only affect calculations when their date arrives.

**Files Modified:**

1. ** - Budget spent amounts calculation**
   - Updated `recalculateBudgetSpentAmounts()` to filter out future transactions
   - Only includes transactions where `date <= today`
   - Ensures budget totals reflect actual spending, not scheduled future spending

2. ** - Period spending calculation**
   - Updated `filterTransactionsByPeriod()` to exclude future dates
   - Dashboard spending widgets now show accurate current totals

3. ** - Analytics calculations**
   - Updated `getTransactionsInRange()` to exclude future transactions
   - Pie charts and bar charts only show actual spending, not future scheduled

**Behavior:**

**Before (Incorrect):**
- Create transaction: Feb 5, 100 CHF
- Budget shows: +100 CHF spent (today is Jan 30) ❌
- Analytics includes this transaction ❌
- Net worth calculation affected ❌

**After (Correct):**
- Create transaction: Feb 5, 100 CHF
- Budget shows: No change (not counted yet) ✓
- Analytics excludes this transaction ✓
- Transaction visible in "Upcoming" section ✓
- On Feb 5: Automatically included in calculations ✓

**What's Excluded:**
- Budget spent amounts
- Period spending calculations
- Dashboard totals
- Analytics charts (pie, bar)
- Category breakdown totals

**What's NOT Affected:**
- Net worth: Based on account balances (not affected by future transactions)
- Transaction list: Future transactions show in "Upcoming" section
- Future transaction editing: Can still create and edit future transactions

**Result:**
- ✅ Future transactions excluded from budget calculations
- ✅ Dashboard shows accurate current spending
- ✅ Analytics reflect actual spending only
- ✅ Budget status correct (not inflated by future expenses)
- ✅ Transactions automatically included when date arrives
- ✅ Consistent date filtering across all calculations

### FEATURE: Redesigned Settlement Screen with Glassmorphism (2026-02-04)

**Feature**: Complete redesign of the Settlement screen with modern glassmorphism UI, payer/receiver views, expense selection, and professional UX.

**Problem**:
The previous settlement flow was basic and didn't match the app's "Calm Financial Control" design philosophy. Users needed a more intuitive, visually appealing way to settle debts with household members.

**Solution**:
Implemented a comprehensive Settlement screen with two distinct views (Payer and Receiver), expense selection, category picker, wallet selector, and settlement summary.

**Implementation**:

**1. New Hook (`src/hooks/useSettlementData.ts`):**
- Fetches all settlement-related data in one place
- Returns: totalOwed, unsettledExpenses, partnerName, splitRatio, wallets, categories
- Handles positive (you owe) and negative (you're owed) debt amounts
- Automatic refetch every 10 seconds for real-time updates

**2. New Components (`src/components/settlement/`):**

**DebtSummaryCard.tsx**:
- Displays "Amount Due" (payer) or "Amount Receivable" (receiver)
- Shows partner name, large amount display (48px), split ratio explanation
- Center-aligned glassmorphism card

**ExpenseSelectionList.tsx (Payer)**:
- Interactive expense selection with checkboxes
- Each item shows: description, date, paid by, total amount, your share
- Selection styling: teal background + teal border when selected
- Checkbox: teal background with white checkmark when selected

**ExpenseStatusList.tsx (Receiver)**:
- Read-only display of outstanding payments
- Same layout as SelectionList but without checkboxes
- Subtle sage green border for visual distinction

**CategorySelector.tsx**:
- Modal picker for budget category selection
- Categories grouped by: Needs, Wants, Savings, Other
- Shows emoji + name for each category
- Helper text: "How should this appear in your budget?"

**WalletSelector.tsx**:
- Radio button style wallet selection
- Shows: wallet icon, name, institution/type, balance
- White radio buttons when selected (per design spec)

**SettlementSummary.tsx**:
- Sage green info box showing selected count and total
- Appears only when expenses are selected

**3. Main Screen (`src/app/settlement/index.tsx`):**
- **Payer View** (totalOwed > 0):
  - Interactive expense selection (all unselected by default)
  - Category dropdown (required, defaults to empty)
  - Wallet selector (defaults to first wallet)
  - Settlement summary with selected total
  - Settle button with validation states
- **Receiver View** (totalOwed < 0):
  - Read-only expense list ("Outstanding" header)
  - No settle button or selections

**4. Settle Button States:**
- **No expenses selected**: "Select expenses to continue" (disabled, teal bg)
- **No category selected**: "Select a category to continue" (disabled, teal bg)
- **Ready**: "Settle {amount} CHF" (enabled, white bg + teal text)
- No external shadows (per design spec)

**5. Design System:**
- Deep Teal: #2C5F5D (primary action, borders)
- Sage Green: #A8B5A1 (accents, status colors)
- Glassmorphism: rgba(255,255,255,0.03) background, border rgba(255,255,255,0.05)
- Selection: rgba(44,95,93,0.2) background + #2C5F5D border
- Swiss currency formatting: 13'648.51 CHF

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `src/hooks/useSettlementData.ts` (NEW)
- `src/components/settlement/DebtSummaryCard.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/components/settlement/ExpenseSelectionList.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/components/settlement/ExpenseStatusList.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/components/settlement/CategorySelector.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/components/settlement/WalletSelector.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/components/settlement/SettlementSummary.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/app/settlement/index.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/app/settlement/_layout.tsx` (NEW)

**Result:**
- ✅ Payer view shows interactive settlement interface
- ✅ Receiver view shows read-only status
- ✅ All expenses unselected by default
- ✅ Category dropdown defaults to empty (required)
- ✅ Settle button uses white bg + teal text when enabled
- ✅ Radio buttons are white when selected
- ✅ Professional labels throughout
- ✅ Settlement creates transactions and marks splits as settled
- ✅ Validation prevents settlement without selections
- ✅ Glassmorphism design matches dashboard aesthetic
